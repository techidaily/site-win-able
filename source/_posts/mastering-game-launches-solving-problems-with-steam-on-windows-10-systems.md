### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is essential to the functioning of PC games. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, you may encounter the issue of Battlefield 4 not launching. To fix the potential problems and enjoy maximum gaming performance, you need to make sure your graphics driver is up to date.

 One way to do that is to visit your graphics card’s official website ( **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  , **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  ) and search for your model, then download and install the graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
