2. [Check if you’re playing different styles](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Deactivate Windows Firewall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

6. [Uninstall and reinstall the game](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1\. Check for the latest version of the game

 This connection issue happens most with multiplayer. If you get this error when you join a friend, you can log out and update Terraria. Also, ensure your friends are using the latest version of Terraria.

This can be done by verifying the game files in Steam.

1. Go to your Steam**Library** .
2. Right-click**Terraria** and click**Properties** .

3. Go to the**Local Files** tab and click “**Verify integrity of game cache** “.  

![verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/INTEGRITY-1.png)

 That will scan your game directory and compare it to the most updated version to find file differences and download files it’s missing.

### Fix 2\. Check if you’re playing different styles

 This error**Terraria Lost Connection** will occur if you don’t have a character to coordinate with the type of map.

 If you have a Classic Map or try to join someone’s Classic Mode game, you should have a Classic Character. Likewise, if you have a Journey Map / want to join a Journey Mode game, you should have a Journey Character.

 Make sure to create a character accordingly before and you won’t be seeing the**Connection Lost** error in Terraria.

### Fix 3\. Deactivate Windows Firewall

 Make sure your Windows Firewall (as well as your antivirus software) is not blocking the connection. To do that, you will need to turn off Windows Firewall and uninstall your antivirus software temporarily. Here’s how:

 If you don’t feel so sure about turning off your Firewall, you can add Terraria to its exception list. Type**Allow an app through Windows Firewall** in the Search box and follow the on-screen instructions to continue.

1. Type**windows defender firewall** in the Search box, and select**Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/win-11-windows-defender.jpg)
2. From the left menu, select **Turn Windows Defender Firewall on or off** .  
![turn off firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Turn-on-or-off.jpg)
3. Select **Turn off Windows Defender Firewall (not recommended)** for Domain network, Private Network, and Public network. Then click **OK** .  
![turn off firewall for all](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/turn-off.jpg)

 After turning off your firewall, restart Terraria to check if the**Connection Lost in Terraria** has been solved.

### Fix 4\. Update your network adapter driver

 If the network adapter driver you’re using is faulty or outdated, you will possibly encounter this ‘Lost Connection’ error in Terraria. To fix the potential problems and ensure less lagging, you should install the latest network driver on your computer.

**Manually –** To update your network adapter driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

**Automatically –**  If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your network adapter, and it will download and install them correctly:
