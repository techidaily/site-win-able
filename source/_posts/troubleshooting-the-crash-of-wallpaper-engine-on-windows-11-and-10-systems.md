## Banish Installation Problems: Enjoy Playing Minecraft on Windows 11 Today

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Minecraft-not-installing.png)

 Minecraft is a sandbox-style game with open online play fosters creativity, which attracts a large number of players to dive into this game. However, users start to complain that this game cannot even be installed on Windows 11\. This can be quite frustrating. If you’re on the same boat, no worries. Here we’ve put together some fixes for you to try.

## Before getting started…

 Before tweaking the settings below, we suggest you**restart your computer** . Rebooting is a troubleshooting step and quick fix to many issues by wiping away the current state of the software, flushing RAM and clearing up temporary files and processes.

 However, if a simple restart doesn’t do the trick, you can**try installing Minecraft from the Microsoft Store Library** .

 You may not need to try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Allow Minecraft installer through firewall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Download & install all Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your device drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

5. **[Run a full scan of your PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1\. Allow Minecraft installer through firewall

 The Windows Firewall is a built-in application that protects users from internet-based threats. However, sometimes it may mistakenly prevent trustworthy software from making changes on your system. To check if that’s your case, you can manually add Minecraft installer to the list of bypassing the firewall. Below are the steps you can take.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. From the left menu, select**Privacy & security** . Then click**Windows Security** .

5. Make sure Minecraft is on the list and the**Private** and**Public** options are checked. If it’s not on the list, that means Minecraft doesn’t have access and you’ll need to click on the**Change settings** button. Then follow the on-screen instructions to add the Minecraft executable file to the list.

 After applying the changes, try installing Minecraft and check if it’s working properly. If your problem persists, proceed to the next fix.

## 3\. Update your device drivers

 Therefore, you’re supposed to always make sure that your device drivers are properly updated.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/update-all-de.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating drivers, restart your computer. Upon the reboot, try to install Minecraft to see if you can do it successfully. If it fails, move on to the next fix.

## 4\. Run Windows Store troubleshooter

 When you have any issues on your system, you can try running the corresponding troubleshooter to see if it helps detect your issues and hopefully fix them.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. Scroll down and find**Troubleshoot** . Make sure you click on it.

3. Click**Other troubleshooters** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/other-troubleshooter.png)
4. Click on the**Run** button next to**Windows Store Apps** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/microsoft-store-apps-run-troubleshooter.png)

 Then wait for it to detect and troubleshoot your issues. If it fails to identify them, try the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 5\. Run a full scan of your PC

 If all else fails, it’s time you check whether you have missing or corrupted system files, which will negatively affect your system’s performance and even trigger some errors. In this situation, you can use the System File Checker (SFC) tool to run the command sfc /scannow. But most of the time it only scans major files and may miss minor issues.

 In this case, you would need to use a more powerful tool to repair your system, and we recommend **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It is an advanced PC repair tool that scans your PC, detects the issue, and solves them automatically, without losing any of your data.

1. **Download** and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC. Upon completion of the scan, the software will conduct a diagnosis and show you a summary of system issues. This will take a few minutes.
3. If it detects any issues on your PC, click **Start Repair** to start the repair process.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fortect-start-repair.jpg)

 Upon the completion of the repair, try to install Minecraft and you should be able to do it successfully.
