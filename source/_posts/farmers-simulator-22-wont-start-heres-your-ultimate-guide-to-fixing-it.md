### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 Game crashes are usually driver-related and can indicate a wrong, faulty or outdated graphics driver. To keep Star Wars Squadrons running smoothly and boost the game’s performance, you should update your graphics driver to the latest.

There are mainly two ways you can do the driver update:

**Option 1 – Manually** – You can search for the most recent graphics driver on your GPU manufacturer’s websites such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  . Then download the driver corresponding with your Windows version, and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
