 You can use the Steam client to verify and repair the game files. Here’s how to do it:

1. Launch**Steam** and go to your**LIBRARY** , then right-click on the Metro Exodus game title and click **Properties…** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)
2. Click **LOCAL FILES** \> **Verify integrity of game files…** . Wait a few minutes for Steam to validate the files of the game.

## Fix 4: Install the latest game patch

 4A Games, the developer of Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition, releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Steam, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Run Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition again to see if the game crashes. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Disable in-game overlays

 In-game overlays are handy, however, sometimes they may interfere with the game and even introduces compatibility issues, which may crash the game.

 Some gamers have proved that turning off the in-game overlay would reduce the chance of game crashing issues. If you’re using the in-game overlay, just disable it to see if the crashing issue persists.

 There’re many apps that support overlay features. Here I’ll take the Steam Overlay as an example to show you how to turn the in-game overlay off in Steam:

1. Launch **Steam** and go to your **LIBRARY** , then right-click on the Metro Exodus game title and click **Properties…** .

![Disable the Steam Overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Disable-the-Steam-Overlay-It-Takes-Two.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features, such as Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc., make sure you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature before you restart the game.

 See if Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition crashes after you disabled all the in-game overlays. If this issue persists, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition may crash if it conflicts with another application on your PC. If don’t know which application conflicts with the game, it’s necessary to perform a clean boot.

 To perform a clean boot, you need to disable the startups and services of all the 3rd party software on your PC first, then restart Windows OS and run the game to see if it crashes.

 If the game runs normally, then you need to enable those startups and services of 3rd party software one by one to find out the software that conflicts with the game.

To perform a clean boot, just follow the steps below:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run Dialog. Type **msconfig** and press **Enter** to open the **System Configuration** window.

**Restart** your PC and run Metro Exodus PC Enhanced Edition to check if the game crashes. If not, you need to open the **System Configuration** window again and enable services and applications **one by one** until you find the problematic software. After enabling each startup service, you need to restart Windows OS to apply the changes.
