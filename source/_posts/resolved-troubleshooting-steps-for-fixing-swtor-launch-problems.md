### Fix 2: Avoid CPU overheating

 If your computer CPU is overheating, you’re likely to have the crashing issue in GTA 5, because your computer can’t work normally when being overheating, especially when it has to deal with the game running. So have a check on your computer and make sure it’s not overheating.

 If you’re CPU is overheating,**clean out your computer case** and guarantee a**proper ventilation** . You can shut down your computer for a while until it’s getting cool and able to process normally.

### Fix 3: Update graphics card driver

 A missing or outdated graphics driver can cause GTA 5 crashing in your Windows, so you can update your graphics card driver to fix the crashing.

 There are two ways to update your graphics card driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manually update your graphics card driver** – You can go to your graphics card manufacturer’s website, find the correct graphics card driver, and install it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatically update your graphics card driver** – If you are not familiar with playing around with drivers, you can do that automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will detect the drivers condition in your computer, and install the correct drivers for your PC. More importantly, with Driver Easy, you don’t need to struggle figuring out the Operating System, and you don’t need to worry about making mistakes while processing. That will tremendously save your time and patience.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will detect the problem drivers in your system.  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Driver-Easy-Scan-Needed.jpg)
3. Click**Update** button next to the driver name to download the correct graphics card driver (you can do that with the**FREE** version), then install it on your computer.  
 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the problem drivers (you can do that with **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , and you will be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)
4. Restart your computer and launch GTA 5 to see if it works.

### Fix 5: Turn on VSync

 VSync stands for Vertical Sync, which is a display option in 3D PC games. It allows you to synchronize the frame rate with the monitor refresh rate for better stability. Having VSync on in GTA 5 has been reported by many players to be an effective way to fix the crashing issue.

To do so:

1. Open GTA 5**Settings** .
2. Click**Graphics** and scroll down. Find**VSync** and turn it**ON** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5ba3522a38573.jpg)  
 If it’s already**ON** , try turning it**OFF** , then restart your game and**turn VSync** **on** again.
3. Restart your PC and GTA 5 again to see if it works.
