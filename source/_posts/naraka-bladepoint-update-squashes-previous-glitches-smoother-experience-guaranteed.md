## 2\. Disable unnecessary programs

 Too many programs running in the background will most likely drain your system as they take up a certain amount of resources. To get a better gaming experience, you’re supposed to disable those programs that you don’t necessarily use when playing Naraka: Bladepoint.

1. On your keyboard, press the Windows logo + R keys simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type or paste**taskmgr** and press Enter to open the Task Manager.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png)
3. Under the Processes tab, right-click the programs that you don’t necessarily use when playing Naraka: Bladepoint and select**End task** .  
 (Be cautious that you should not end processes that are essential for running Windows, otherwise your computer may fail to work properly. )  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disable-programs-running-in-the-backgroundend-task.jpg)  

 After you’ve done these, play your game. If you’re still having sudden extreme framerate drops and stuttering during the gameplay, proceed to the next fix.

## 3\. Enable the Game Mode

 Players who have the latest Windows version should enable the Game Mode, a feature that is designed to optimize Windows 10 for gaming. It can deactivate background activities to help you boost in-game FPS. To enable the Game Mode, follow the instructions below.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. Select**Gaming** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/turn-on-game-mode.png)  

 Now launch Naraka: Bladepoint and you should get a better performance. However, if turning on Game Mode didn’t do the trick, don’t worry. Below are some other methods that you can try.

## 4\. Update your graphics driver

 Famous graphics card manufacturers usually release game ready drivers to offer players a smooth gameplay. This is probably the best shot you have got without doing a lot of troubleshooting.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your graphics driver:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

### Option 1 – Manually update your graphics driver

 To update your graphics driver manually, you can go to the official website:

[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download-center/home.html)

 Then find the driver corresponding with your Windows version and download it manually. Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 As described above, manually updating your graphics driver would require a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an automatic driver updater such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as it will take care of the busy work for you.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any devices with missing or outdated drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/scan-now-v5_7_0.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** . Driver Easy will then download and update all your outdated and missing device drivers, giving you the latest version of each, direct from the device manufacturer.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/update-all-NVIDIA-RTX-2080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating drivers, restart your PC. Then you can play your game. If constant stutters and framerate drops still occur, try the next fix below.

## 5\. Verify integrity of game files

 When you’re having performance issues, verifying game files may work like magic. It can help you verify if the integrity of your game files are intact. If it is not, it’ll then restore any missing or replace any corrupted files. To do this, follow the instructions below.

1. Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steam-properties.jpg)
2. Select **LOCAL FILES** . Then click **Verify integrity of game files…** . Then wait for the process to complete.  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087484/7443" target="_top" id="2087484"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087484" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087484/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/verify-integrity-of-game-files-1.png)  

 The verification process would take several minutes to finish. After that, play Naraka: Bladepoint to check if your problems have been solved. If you are still having these problems, proceed to the next fix.

## 6\. Disable overlays

 Overlay technology is commonly used in various programs. It allows you to surf the web and enjoy other features, but can also cause performance issues with some games. Therefore, you may need to disable Steam overlay and check if it can give you a boost in average FPS and reduce in-game stutters. Here’s how you can do this:

1. Open your Steam client.
2. Click **Steam** from the sidebar and select **Settings** .  

![disable Steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-Steam-overlay-1.jpg)
3. Click**In-Game** . Uncheck the box**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** . Then click**OK** to save the changes.  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793233/19578" target="_top" id="1793233"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793233" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793233/19578" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![disable Steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-Steam-overlay-2.jpg)  

 After saving the changes, launch your game and you should be able to get more FPS and reduce in-game stutters. Also, if you have Discord installed, try to disable overlay by following the steps below.

1. Open Discord.
2. Click the **cogwheel icon** at the bottom of the left pane to open Settings.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/7-2-1-1.jpg)
3. Select the **Game Overlay** tab in the left pane and toggle off **Enable in-game overlay** .

1. From your desktop, right-click the empty space and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075482/7443" target="_top" id="2075482"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075482" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075482/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/from-the-desktop.png)
2. Click**Manage 3D settings** . Then select**Program Settings** . Add**NARAKA: BLADEPOINT** to the list. Under the section Specify the settings for this program, make the following changes:
