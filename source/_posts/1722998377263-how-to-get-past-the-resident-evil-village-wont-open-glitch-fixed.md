### 1\. Disable in-game Overlay

 Overlays sometimes eat up bandwidth or introduce compatibility problems, thus causing problems in games, and that includes Resident Evil Village not launching or crashing on start up.

 Turning off in-game overlay has been proved helpful by many Resident Evil Village players. If you’re using apps with overlay features, just disable every single one of them such as Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Steam, etc.

#### Disabling Discord Overlay

1. Launch the Discord app.
2. Click the **Settings** icon, and then select the **Overlay** tab.
3. Toggle the switch to disable the **Enable in-game overlay** option.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-game-overlay-discord.jpg)

 Note: If you want to diable it just for Resident Evil Village, you can go to**Settings** \>**Games** , and togglle**Resident Evil Village** to**Off** .

#### Disabling the GeForce Experience In-Game Overlay

1. From the GeForce Experience app, click the**Settings** icon on the top right corner.
2. From the**GENERAL** panel, toggle the**SHARE** setting to off.

#### Disabling Steam Overlay

1. Open the Steam client and navigate to the **Steam > Settings/Preferences > In-game** tab.
2. Uncheck the box next to **Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .

* Nvidia Shadowplay/Share
* Overwolf
* Razer Synapse Stats
* Razer Cortex Gamecaster
* Xbox Game DVR
* Twitch
* Plays TV

 Check if you’re having other common overlay applications installed and learn how to disable them. Once they’re disabled, you can launch your game and test the issue. If Resident Evil Village is still not launching, you can try the fix below.

### 2\. Update to the latest Game Ready driver

 Both Nvidia and AMD’s newly released game-ready driver provides optimal support for Resident Evil Village. So if you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time, make sure you do so before trying other fixes.

There’re mainly two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

**Manually –** To update your graphics driver to the latest version, you’ll need to visit the manufacturer’s website, download the exact driver, and then install it manually.

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* [**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

**Automatically –**  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scan-now-1.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/3080.jpg)

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click _Update All_ .)

 4) Once the driver is updated, reboot your PC for the changes to take effect.

### 3\. Verify game integrity on Steam

 It’s always recommended to verify the game files when you’re experiencing game issues. This will help you rule out the possibility of corrupted game files. Here’s how to do it:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Verify-Integrity-of-Game-Files.jpg)

 4) Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes.

### 4\. Disable your antivirus software temporarily

 It’s very likely that your antivirus software is interfering with the game, preventing your game from launching normally. To fix this, you can try disabling your antivirus software or add your game to its exception list.

 There might be software conflict with other software, so you can perform a clean boot so that you can start Windows only with the essential programs.,

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**msconfig** and click**OK** .
