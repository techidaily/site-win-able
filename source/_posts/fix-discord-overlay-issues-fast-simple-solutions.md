### Bonus tip: How to fix Discord connection errors?

 It’s very frustrating to run into the voice connection issue when playing the game. But don’t worry, most voice connection errors can be fixed by configuring a VPN connection.

 Please note that **Discord only works on VPNs that have UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** . If you’re not sure which VPN service you should choose, here we recommend**NordVPN** to you.

 NordVPN helps you set up a fast, stable, and secure Internet connection anywhere. And it helps you do this with just a few clicks or taps! What’s more, with one NordVPN account, you can set up a VPN connection on all devices. NordVPN allows you to connect up to 6 devices at the same time!

#### To Set up a VPN connection on your Windows PC

 1) Before visiting the official website of NordVPN, **get a[NordVPN coupon code](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) first!** Then head to[the official website of NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Follow the steps on its web page to**select your plan** and**create your NordVPN account** .

 2) On your Windows PC, visit **[the NordVPN download page](https://nordvpn.com/download/windows/)**  to download and install it.

 3) Launch NordVPN. Enter your NordVPN account and password, then click**Sign In** .

 4) Click**Quick connect** to automatically connect to the server recommended for you. If you want to connect to another VPN server in a specific country, just select the server you want to connect to on the left panel or click on the country pin on the map.

![This image has an empty alt attribute; its file name is Snap915.png](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Snap915.png)

 Normally, after configuring the VPN, the voice connection issues should be fixed.
