 There’re 5 fixes that have helped many users solve their problems. You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

2. [Your ISP might be throttling](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Check your hard drive space](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Reinstall the application](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Check firewall settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Check the number of seed/peer

 The Stalled status usually appeared when you try to download torrents that have a low number of seed/peers. So you can check the number of speed/peer first. You can reconnect to peers by reinserting torrent in it and the speed will recover a bit. It’s just a temporary fix but worth trying.

 If your speed/peers were fine, you can restart the qBittorrent. Some users said after reboot the program, the qBittorrent client works like a charm.

### Fix 2: Your ISP might be throttling

 If your speed/peers were fine and restarting doesn’t make a difference, check your internet connection. Your ISP might be throttling which leads to Stalled status.

 Some ISPs limit the amount of high-speed data you can access, to make sure, you need to test your internet speed.

1. Test your internet speed without a VPN. Keep the number.
2. Run your VPN service. If you don’t have VPN,[download and install NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
3. Launch NordVPN and click**Connect** .

4. Test your internet speed with[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Since[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) hides your IP address from your ISP, you’ll get an accurate reading of your real internet speed. If the number has a big difference, your ISP might be throttling.

Then you should use NordVPN when downloading torrents with qBittorrent.

### Fix 3: Check your hard drive space

 Some users have reported when your drive was full, no more data could be written to it which cause the qBittorrent to be stalled issue.
