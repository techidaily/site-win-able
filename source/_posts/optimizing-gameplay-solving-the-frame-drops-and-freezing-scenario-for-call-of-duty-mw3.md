1. **[Make sure your PC is capable](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Download your game updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Close background processes](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Check for Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Verify integrity of game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

9. **[Scan your PC for corrupted files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1\. Make sure your PC is capable

 Before tweaking Windows and in-game settings, you’ll first need to make sure that you have at least**the minimum required specs** on your PC

> _**64-bit processor and operating system required**_
> _**operating system: Windows® 7**_
> _**processor: Intel Core i3-9100 / AMD Ryzen 3 2300X**_
> _**RAM: 8 GB RAM**_
> _**Graphics card: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 1050 Ti / AMD Radeon™ RX 560 (4GB VRAM)**_
> _**storage: 60 GB free space required**_

 When the hardware you currently have meets the requirements, you can try the methods below for improving your low frame rate.

## 2\. Download your game updates

 Early in the life cycle of a new title, developers release patches with major performance impacts and bug fixes. So enable the automatic updates to ensure you don’t miss one. By default, auto-update is enabled. But sometimes that may not be your case. Thus you can manually enable it on[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[Epic Games Launcher](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) by following the instructions below.

#### On Steam

 1) Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .

 1) Open your Epic Games Launcher. Navigate to your game in the**LIBRARY** .

 2) Click on the**gear icon (three dots)** next to your game to enter the Settings menu.

 3) Make sure the option**Auto Update** is toggled**on** .

 If having the latest game updates doesn’t give you the best performance, you should try the next fix below.

## 3\. Close background processes

 There are certain background programs that are known for resource-hogging. They can slow things down and also throttling your bandwidth, which will be a problem for multiplayer and connection-dependent games. To prevent this from happening, follow the steps below to close some background processes.

 (Screenshots below come from Windows 10\. If you’re running Windows 11, your screen will look slightly different. But the steps taken are exactly the same. )

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to bring up the Run box.

 2) Type**taskmgr** and press Enter.  
  
![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png)

 3) Click the**CPU or Memory tab** to check whether anything is using up large chunks of your CPU or RAM (for instance, a web browser with dozens of tabs open).

## 6\. Verify integrity of game files

 This may resolve installation corruption that prevents you from being able to enjoy the game to the fullest.

 Now follow the steps below to verify cache files on[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or[Epic Games Launcher](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### On Steam

1) Open your Steam client.

2) Under LIBRARY, right-click**Dying Light 2** and select**Properties** .  
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dying-Light-2-verify-integrity-of-game-files-properties-1.png)

 2) Select the **LOCAL FILES**  tab. Then click **Verify integrity of game files…** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://order.glarysoft.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4691139&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/6734fa703f6633ab896eecbdfad8953a/products/SU-200-1.png" border="0">Software Update Pro - Check and update software installed on your computer. </a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dying-Light-2-verify-integrity-of-game-files.png)

 Now Steam will verify your game’s files. This process may take several minutes. Once the process is completed, close the Window then launch your game. If you’re still getting low FPS and massive stutters, move on to the[next fix](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### On Epic Games Launcher

 1) Open your Epic Games Launcher. Navigate to your game in the**LIBRARY** .

 2) Click on the**gear icon (three dots)** next to your game to enter the Settings menu.

 3) Select**Verify** from the drop-down.

 Depending on the size of the game it may take a few minutes to verify all your files. Once it completes, launch your game and test the gameplay.

## 7\. Change in-game settings

 Most games will automatically test your PC after installation and assign custom settings. However, those settings don’t give frame rate the priority you’d like. Here are a few common settings to turn down (or off) for measurable performance boosts.

 1) Head across to the**Options** menu.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dying-Light-2-settings-options.png)

 2) Select the**VIDEO** tab at the very top. Then make the following changes：

**Window Mode:** Fullscreen  
**Resolution:** Set this option here to match the resolution of your display and no higher or now lower.  
**Vertical Synchronization:** Off

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Video-settings-Dyling-Light-2-1200x701.png)

Now scroll down and make these changes:

**Particles Quality:** Low  
**Contact Shadows Quality:** None  
**Ambient Occlusion Quality:** None  
**Global Illumination Quality:** Low  
**Global Illumination Quality:** Low  
**Reflection Quality:** Low  
**Fog Quality:** Low

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image.png)

 Then apply the changes. Press the**Esc** key and click**OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://store.nero.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=42296740&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.nero.com/nero-com-wAssets/img/banners/2023/biu/Nero_BackItUp_Screen_2.webp" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/apply-the-changes.png)

 However, by applying these changes, you’ll have to settle for less in-game visual detail. If you find you’re sacrificing too much in your graphical settings to hit your frame rate target, there’s always another option: Upgrading to a new system with a faster GPU and CPU.

## 8\. Enable hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling

 The next method you should try is to enable the hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling. It is a feature that comes with a recent Windows update designed to boost in-game FPS. If you have the latest Windows version, a Geforce 10 series or later/ Radeon 5600 or 5700 series graphics card with the latest driver, you can enable this feature and see if you can notice a performance improvement. Now follow the steps below to enable it.

 (Screenshots below come from Windows 10\. If you’re running Windows 11, your screen might look slightly different. )

 1) In the search box, type**graphics settings** .

 3) Navigate to your game’s installation folder. If you’re on Steam, follow the instructions below to locate your game’s installation folder.

 (If you’re playing it on Epic Games Launcher, it’s Default: **C:\\Program Files\\Epic Games\\\[Game Name\]** by default. )

Locate the game’s installation folder on Steam:

* Open your Steam client.
* Under LIBRARY, right-click**Dying Light 2** and select**Manage** **\> Browse local files** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dying-light-2-browse-local-files.png)

* Then open the files**ph > work > bin > x64** . Click the very top to copy the file path.

 4) Paste the path of the game’s installation file into the address bar. Then double-click on the game’s exe.file.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Dying-Light-2-add-to-the-list-gpu-scheduling.png)

 5) Once it’s added to the list, simply select it and click**Options** .  
  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/options.png)

 6) Choose**High performance** and click**Save** .  
  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793237/19578" target="_top" id="1793237"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793237" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="1200"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793237/19578" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/high-performance-1.png)

 Doing this will make sure that the game runs on the best graphics processor you have on your computer, not holding back any performance.

 However, if this doesn’t give you any performance boost, try the next fix below.

## 9\. Scan your PC for corrupted files

 Graphics glitches and other critical issues can occur when your operating system becomes corrupted. Opening programs will be slower and response time will lag. To diagnose the problem you’re having, you should run a full scan on your system.

 You can do it manually, for sure. But this could take hours and you might end up not solving your issues. In this case, you can use **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a more powerful tool that scans your computer for invalid registry issues, fragmented files, and Windows tweaks.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.

 2) Open Fortect and it will run a free scan of your PC and give you a detailed report of your PC status. This will take a few minutes.

 3) If Fortect detects any issues on your PC, click**Start Repair** to start the repair process.
