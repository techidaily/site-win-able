 When this problem occurs, the first thing you should do is always to check out whether your network is good. Here is how:

 Try opening another web browser or running an application that requires Internet access to function. If the browser or the application fails too, then the problem is with your network connection instead of Internet Explorer. Contact your Internet service provider for assistance.

 If other applications are working fine on your computer, don’t fret. Read on and check the fix below.

### Fix 2: Clear cache and cookies in Internet Explorer

**2)** On your keyboard, press the**Ctrl, Shift** and**Del** keys at the same time.

 Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.
