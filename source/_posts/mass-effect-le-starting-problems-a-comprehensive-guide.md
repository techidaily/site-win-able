### Fix 1: Use wire headsets

 Some players have found out the game need to use a 3.5mm jack to bypass the headsets audio. Therefore, use a wired input instead of USB headphones. USB headphones are not working well with Evil Genius 2.

Hope it works for you, if not, try updating your audio driver.

### Fix 2: Update the audio driver

 Update your audio driver might fix. Driver is closely related to the audio issue, an outdated or corrupted audio driver would cause sound issue.

 You can not also update the driver manually via Device Manager or your driver’s manufacturer’s official website, but also update it automatically with[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:
