### Fix 1: Update your video driver

 Perhaps the most common cause of the ‘**Internet Explorer has stopped working** ’ error is an outdated/corrupted/faulty**video driver** . So you should update your video driver to see if it fixes the issue.  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run**Driver Easy** and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_ALL_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

4. Restart your computer and check if Internet Explorer works properly. If the problem still exists, then move on to **Fix 2** , below.

---

### Fix 2: Disable add-ons

 Add-ons are extensions to Internet Explorer that allow you to do more things in your browser, or which improve your user experience. For example, the AdBlock add-on  blocks ads. Extensions are sometimes added manually and sometimes added by other programs on your computer (hopefully with your permission).

 If one of your add-ons is faulty, or for some reason conflicts with your browser or your other add-ons, it can cause the **Internet Explorer has stopped working** issue.

 To see if this is your problem, you need to temporarily disable all your add-ons, then check if Internet Explorer is working properly. If it is, it’s likely that one of your add-ons is causing the problem, and you simply need to figure out which one. Here’s how to do this:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key**  and**R** at the same time, then type **inetcpl.cpl** and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc706de27b22.png)
2. Click **Programs** \>**Manage add-ons** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5b0d0662b2bda.jpg)
3. You’ll then see a list of all your Internet Explorer add-ons. Disable**each add-on** in the list, one at at time, by clicking it, then clicking**Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5b0d0bb770ebc.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. **Restart** your computer and check if Internet Explorernow works:  
   * If Internet Explorer does work after disabling all your add-ons, it’s likely one of your add-ons was the problem. Now you just need to figure out which one. To do this, enable the first add-on in the list, then see if Internet Explorer still works. If it doesn’t, then you’ve found the cause of the problem. If Internet Explorer works fine after enabling the first add-on, enable the second and test again. Continue testing each add-on in this way until you find the one that stops Internet Explorer from working. Once you find it, disable it again. If you need it, contact the vendor for support.  
   * If disabling your add-ons doesn’t solve your problem, move on to**Fix 3** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3: Uninstall toolbars

 Toolbars in Internet Explorer are very much like add-ons. They improve your browsing experience and add functionality. If one of your toolbars is faulty, or for some reason conflicts with your browser or your other toolbars, it can cause the**Internet Explorer has stopped working** problem.

 To see if this is your problem, you need to temporarily uninstall all your third-party browser toolbars, then check if Internet Explorer is working properly. If it is, it’s likely that one of your toolbars is causing the problem, and you simply need to figure out which one. Here’s how to do this:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, then type **appwiz.cpl**  and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc70860ce2fe.png)
2. Right-click on **the each toolbar** in your list of programs and features **and clickUninstall** / ****Change .**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Click**Yes** to confirm.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bcd64bdd78f4.jpg)
4. **Restart** your computer and check if Internet Explorernow works.  
   * If Internet Explorer does work after uninstalling all your toolbars, it’s likely one of your toolbars was the problem. Now you just need to figure out which one. To do this, you can try to reinstall one of your original toolbars, then see if Internet Explorer still works. If it doesn’t, then you’ve found the cause of the problem. If Internet Explorer works fine after reinstalling the toolbar, reinstall another one and test again. Continue testing each toolbar in this way until you find the one that stops Internet Explorer from working. Once you find it, uninstall it again. If you need it, contact the vendor for support.  
   * If uninstalling your toolbars doesn’t solve your problem, move on to**Fix 4** .

### Fix 4: Change your hardware acceleration setting

 Hardware Acceleration or GPU Rendering is a new feature in Internet Explorer that makes your GPU do all  graphics and text rendering. Some computers perform better with it turned on, some perform better with it turned off.

 Your setting here may be causing Internet Explorer to stop working. If you have hardware acceleration turned on, you should turn it off and see if that resolves the problem. And if you already have it turned on, you should turn it off and see.

Here’s how to do it…

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, then type **inetcpl.cpl** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc706de27b22.png)
2. Click **Advanced**  , and check whether the **Use software rendering instead of GPU rendering** checkbox is ticked. If it is ticked, un-tick it. If it’s not ticked, tick it. Then click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc98b95b2550.jpg)
3. **Restart**  your computer and see if Internet Explorer works properly. If not, move on to **Fix 5** , below.

### Fix 5: Reset your security zones to their default levels

 If you’ve changed Internet Explorer’s s  ecurity zone settings, or if an app has changed them, this can sometimes cause **Internet Explorer has stopped working** problem. You may be able to resolve the problem by resetting your security zones to their default levels.

**Important** : If you reset Internet Explorer’s security zones back to their default levels, some of your cookie-dependent settings will also be reset. In particular, this will delete any pinned tabs, passwords and add-ons. It won’t affect your bookmarks, though.

 To reset your security zones to their default levels:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time, then type **inetcpl.cpl** and press **Enter** .

### Fix 6: Reinstall Internet Explorer
