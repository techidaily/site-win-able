 It may take a couple of minutes for the process to complete. Once done, restart the game to test the issue. If the problem persists, move on to more fixes below.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 Game issues are usually driver-related. If you’re using a broken or outdated graphics driver, Lost Ark may not launch the right way. To gain the best in-game performance, you should update your graphics drivers regularly.

 Main graphics card manufacturers constantly roll out new drivers for the latest titles. You could visit their official websites ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)**  ), find the driver corresponding with your operating system, download and install it manually.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).  

 You can also get the drivers you need for free, but you’ll need to download them one at a time and manually install it.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/gtx-1650-driver-de.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 A driver update should greatly improve your game experience. But if this doesn’t resolve the problem, check out the next solution.

### Fix 4 – Run Lost Ark as an administrator

 Due to the lack of administrative rights, a program or game may not access certain files and therefore fails to launch. To avoid permission issues like this, you should run Lost Ark as an administrator as follow.

1. Go to the Lost Ark installation folder, which you can find at_C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Lost Ark\\Binaries_ \\_Win64_ . If it’s not there, launch your Steam client, right-click the game, select**Properties** \>**Local Files** \>**Browse local files** .
2. Right-click the**LOSTARK.exe file** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/run-as-administrator-lost-ark-2.jpg)
3. Select the**Compatibility** tab. Tick**Disable full-screen optimizations** and**Run this program as an administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/run-as-administrator-lost-ark-1.jpg)
4. Click**OK** .

 Try launching the game to see how things go. Still no luck? Take a look at the next method.

### Fix 5 – Turn off unnecessary programs

 When you have too many programs running in the background, it can eat up the system resources (CPU and bandwidth), and therefore make your Lost Ark not launch or work. To solve this, just shut down all the unnecessary programs besides Steam and the game launcher.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Type**taskmgr** and press**Enter** .

### Fix 6 – Switch to DX9
