### Method 2: Update your video card driver

 This problem could be also due to an old or corrupted driver, particularly your video card driver. You could solve it through updating your device driver.

 You can choose to download a latest video card driver from your computer manufacturer’s website or your video card manufacturer’s website, like NVIDIA, AMD, Intel. Then install the new driver on your Windows 10.

 Or if you are not confident working with drivers manually or you don’t have enough time, we recommend you do it automatically with  **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy. Then run it on your Windows.
2. Click **Scan Now** . It will quickly detect all drivers problems of your computer. Your video card driver is no exception.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/driver-easy-scan.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/driver-easy-update.jpg)
4. Reboot your Windows and try to run your game on Steam to see if it works.

### Method 3: Verify your game cache files

 An corrupted game cache file can also prevent your games from launching properly.

Follow these to verify your game cache files:

1. Reboot your Windows and run Steam.
2. Right-click on your game in the**LIBRARY**  section. Then click **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59e46fdf19866.jpg)
3. Click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…**  in **LOCAL FILES** .

### Method 4: Close unnecessary programs

 Some programs running on your Windows 10 may interfere the performance of Steam. Try to close those unnecessary programs. Then reboot your Windows and try to run your game on Steam to see if it works.

### Method 5: Check for damaged system files

 Missing or corrupted system files can lead to various types of PC problems and cause your Steam games to crash or not start. To check if your system is corrupted while optimizing its capabilities and performance, you could use a professional PC repair tool.

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a Windows repair solution with various powerful functions.
