 5) Steam will check your game files and fix any detected problems. Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.

 6) Restart Steam, and open Final Fantasy XV again and see if it works properly.

 If your game stops crashing, that’s perfect. But if your problem persists, don’t worry. There are other solutions.

### Fix 3: Roll back your graphics card driver

 If you’ve updated your graphics card driver right before Final Fantasy keeps crashing, your problem probably lies in your graphics card driver. In this case, you can roll back your graphics driver.

 There are two ways to roll back your graphics card driver:**manually** and**automatically** .

* Manually roll back your driver: you can roll back your graphics card driver by navigating to**Device Manager** \>**Display adapters** \>**Properties** \>**Driver** \>**Roll Back Driver** .

This requires time and computer skills.

* Automatically roll back your driver: if you don’t have the time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy handles it all.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the Free or Pro version. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks (and you’ll get**30-day money back guarantee** ).

### Fix 5: Disable NVIDIA Turf Effects

 NVIDIA Turf Effects simulates and renders large grass areas, which provides you with a best possible experience when playing Final Fantasy. However, Turf Effects may cause a memory problem and that could be a reason of your game crashing.

To resolve Final Fantasy crashing, you can disable NVIDIA Turf Effects.

 1) Launch FFXV**Settings** .

 2) Go to**Graphics** \>**NVIDIA TurfEffects** . Then set it to**Off** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Snap51.jpg)

3) Save your changes and relaunch FFXV.

 If you can’t open Settings in Final Fantasy XV, you can modify the game settings file in your computer, and change**NvidiaTurf=0** . This will disable NVIDIA Turf Effects for your game.

Hopefully your game will be running up again properly.
