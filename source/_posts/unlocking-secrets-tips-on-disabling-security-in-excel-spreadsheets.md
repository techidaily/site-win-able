##  Unprotecting a Workbook vs. Unprotecting a Worksheet

 If you'd like to make structural changes to your workbook, like adding, moving, deleting, hiding, or renaming your worksheets, you'll have to unprotect your workbook (as opposed to unprotecting a worksheet). Doing that unlocks the options to make the above-mentioned changes to your workbook.

 In case you're looking to modify the data in your worksheet, such as changing the content of a cell, you'll have to unprotect your sheet. This allows you to add and remove content from your worksheet.

 Either way, it's easy to unprotect your items in Excel as we'll explain below.
