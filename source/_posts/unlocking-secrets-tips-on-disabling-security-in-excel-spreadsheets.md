##  Unprotecting a Workbook vs. Unprotecting a Worksheet

 If you'd like to make structural changes to your workbook, like adding, moving, deleting, hiding, or renaming your worksheets, you'll have to unprotect your workbook (as opposed to unprotecting a worksheet). Doing that unlocks the options to make the above-mentioned changes to your workbook.

 In case you're looking to modify the data in your worksheet, such as changing the content of a cell, you'll have to unprotect your sheet. This allows you to add and remove content from your worksheet.

 Either way, it's easy to unprotect your items in Excel as we'll explain below.

##  Unprotect an Excel Workbook

 To be able to make structural changes to your workbook, first, launch your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel.

 In [Excel's ribbon at the top](https://screen-mirror.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-mirror-honor-play-40c-to-mac-drfone-by-drfone-android/), click the "Review" tab.

![Select the "Review" tab at the top.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1-excel-review-tab.png) 

 On the "Review" tab, from the "Protect" section, choose "Protect Workbook."

![Select "Protect Workbook."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/2-unprotect-excel-workbook.png) 

 If you didn't use a password to protect your workbook, your workbook is now unprotected.

 In case you used a password for protection, then in the "Unprotect Workbook" box that opens, type that password and click "OK."

![Enter the workbook password and click "OK."](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/3-enter-excel-workbook-password.png)

Enjoy!
