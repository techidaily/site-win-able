## Mastering the Dark Mode Dilemma in Halo Infinite - Now Solved

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HaloInfinite_Multiplayer-1200x675.jpg)

 Halo Infinite multiplayer beta is now available. However, many players are reporting that they cannot launch the game and get a black screen with a little circle in the bottom left corner. Then the game crashes after a few seconds. If you’re facing the same issue, don’t worry. Here are some quick fixes for you.

## Before you start

 To troubleshoot the black screen issue, you should first make sure your PC meets the game’s system requirements. Here we listed the minimum and recommended requirements for Halo Infinite:

| OS:        | Windows 10 RS5 x64                |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Processor: | AMD Ryzen 5 1600 or Intel i5-4440 |
| Graphics:  | AMD RX 570 or Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti  |
| Memory:    | 8 GB RAM                          |

Minimum requirements

| OS:        | Windows 10 19H2 x64                  |

| Memory:    | 16 GB RAM                            |

Recommended

 After confirming that your PC is powerful enough to run the game, go ahead with the following fixes.

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all. Simply work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Verify the integrity of game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Check for Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Allow the game through Windows Firewall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Perform a clean boot](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Reinstall Hallo Infinite](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Verify the integrity of game files

 If there are any missing or corrupted game files, you may encounter the black screen issue in Halo Infinite. To rule out the issue, you can verify the integrity of game files via Steam. Here’s how:

1. Run Steam and click**LIBRARY** .
2. Right-click**Halo Infinite** and select**Properties…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-infinite-steam-properties.jpg)
3. Navigate to the**LOCAL FILE** S tab and select**Verify integrity of game files…** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/halo-infinite-steam-verify-game-files.jpg)
4. Steam will verify the game’s files. This process may take several minutes.

 Once the process is completed, try launching the game again to see if you can get past the black screen.

If the issue remains, check out the next fix.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 A faulty or outdated graphics driver could impact your game performance and cause the black screen issue. To ensure Halo Infinite works properly on your device, you need to keep your graphics driver up to date.

 One way to do that is to visit the manufacturer’s website ( **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , **[AMD](http://www.amd.com/drivers)**  or **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**  ) and search for your model, then download and install the latest graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/de-scan-now-20-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is to download them one at a time and manually install them.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/de-nvidia-gtx-1080.jpg)

 The **Pro version** of Driver Easy comes with **full technical support** . If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 After updating your graphics driver, restart your PC and launch Halo Infinite again to see if your problem is resolved.

If the issue persists, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 3: Check for Windows updates

 Much like cell phone updates, Windows updates are intended to give you new functionality, security improvement and bug fixes, helping your device run smoothly and efficiently. If you can’t remember the last time you ran Windows Update, you should give it a try now. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open the**Windows Settings** . Then click**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/updates-security.jpg)
2. Under Windows Update, click**Check for updates** . Windows will automatically download and install the available updates.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/check-for-updates.jpg)

 Once you’ve installed all the updates, restart your computer and launch Halo Infinite again to see if the black screen issue has gone away.

 If your system is up to date and you still get a black screen, move on to the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4: Allow the game through Windows Firewall

 Windows Firewall may block the normal operation of your game and cause the black screen issue. To fix the potential problem, you need to add Halo Infinite to the exception list of Windows Firewall. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type**firewall.cpl** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firewall.cpl_.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, click**Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/allow-an-app.jpg)
3. Locate**HaloInfinite.exe** from the list of apps. If not listed, click**Change settings > Allow another app…** , then locate**HaloInfinite.exe** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/change-settings.jpg)
4. Checkmark both**Private** and**Public** settings.
5. Click**OK** .

 If you’re also running any third-party antivirus program, you should temporarily disable it before launching the game.

 Check if you still get a black screen when launching Halo Infinite. If the issue persists, continue with the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5: Perform a clean boot

 The Halo Infinite black screen issue may also be caused by software conflicts. To see if that’s the case, you can perform a clean boot. This will restart your PC with only essential services running, allowing you to figure out the potential conflicting software. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type**msconfig** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/msconfig.jpg)
2. In System Configuration, navigate to the**Services** tab and check the box next to**Hide all Microsoft services** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/hide2.jpg)
4. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** at the same time to open**Task Manager** , then navigate to the**Startup** tab.

 If you won’t see a black screen again, then try enabling services one by one until you find the conflicting software. Be sure to restart your PC after enabling each service.

 Once you find out the problematic program that causes the black screen issue, you may need to uninstall it to avoid running into the same issue in the future.

 If the black screen issue still occurs after you disable all unnecessary services, check out the last fix.
