| **Graphics**  | AMD RX 570 or Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti  |
| **DirectX**   | Version 12                        |
| **Storage**   | 50 GB available space             |

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:
