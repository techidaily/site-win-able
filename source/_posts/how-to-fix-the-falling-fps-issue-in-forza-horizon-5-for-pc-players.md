1. **[Check your system specs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Check your system specs

 If your game wonâ€™t launch at all, chances are that youâ€™re running a game that stretches your PC beyond its abilities.

 You should verify that your system meets the minimum system requirements to run the game. If your PC below the recommended spec,   **try lowering your resolution and graphics and in-game video settings** .

 Here are the **minimum**  system requirements to play_Forza Horizon 4_ :

| **OS:**            | Windows 10 64-bit               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **DirectX** :      | Version 12                      |
| **Memory** :       | 8GB RAM                         |
| **Processor:**     | Intel Core i3-4170 or higher    |
| **Graphics card:** | Nvidia GTX 650Ti or AMD R7 250X |
| **Storage** :      | 70GB available space            |

 Here are the**recommended** system requirements to run_Forza Horizon 4_ :

| **OS:**            | Windows 10 64-bit              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **DirectX:**       | Version 12                     |
| **Memory:**        | 12GB RAM                       |
| **Processor:**     | Intel Core i7-3820 or higher.  |
| **Graphics card:** | Nvidia GTX 970 or AMD R9 290X. |
| **Storage:**       | 70GB available space           |

 Make sure your PC is above the minimum system requirements to run the game, then move on and try the fix below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of the_Forza Horizon 4_ not launching problem is a faulty or outdated graphics driver. You should update your graphics driver to see if thatâ€™s the case for you.

 If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
