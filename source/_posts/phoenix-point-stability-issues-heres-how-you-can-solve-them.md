### Fix 1: Install the latest patch

 Outdated versions of the software may bring buggy issues when you’re using the software, and The Sims 4 is no exception. That’s why the software developers keep releasing new patches to fix bugs and improve features.

 So check for updates for The Sims 4 and install any available updates. Then restart your computer and see if your game stops crashing or not.

 If this method didn’t work for you, don’t worry. There are other solutions.

---

### Fix 2: Stop overclocking your CPU

 Overclocking means setting your CPU and memory to run at speeds higher than their official speed rate, and almost all processors ship with a speed rating. However, this may cause your game crashing or freezing. In that case, you should set your CPU clock speed rate back to the default to fix your issue.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 The missing or outdated graphics card driver results in your game crashing, and that’s one of the common reasons why The Sims 4 keeps crashing to desktop. To rule it out as the cause for your problem, update your graphics card driver to the latest version.

 There are two ways to update your device drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  : You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-the-sims-4-crashing-on-pc/#w2)**  : This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### Option 1: Download and install the driver manually

 Your device manufacturers keep updating device drivers. To get them, you need to go to the manufacturer website of your graphics card, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version ( for example, Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2: Automatically update your drivers

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detest any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or outdated on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**_Update All_** ).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-77.png)

**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

4) Restart your computer to take effect.

Now launch The Sims 4 and see if it works.

---

### Fix 4: Try Repair in the Origin client

 If the Sims 4 still crashes in your computer, you can repair your game issue by the Repair Game feature in Origin.

To do so, follow these steps:

 1) Open the**Origin** client and go to**My Game Library** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-200.png)

 2) Right click on**The Sims 4** and click**Repair** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/image-201.png)

3) Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the process.

4) Restart your computer. Then launch your game to see if it works.

Still no luck? Don’t worry. There is something else to try.

Re-launch The Sims 4 and see if it works.

## Why does my Sims 4 game keep crashing?

 It’s not uncommon that games crash either on startup or in the middle of playing. First of all, you should check your PC hardware and the system requirements to play your game, then make sure your PC meets the minimum system requirements (though this could cause crashing sometimes). In addition to the system requirements, you should modify the graphics settings for your game, in order to not overload your system resources when playing your game.

 What’s more, as corrupted or missing drivers can result in system errors, including game crashing, it’s always a go-to option to update your hardware device drivers, which could bring the best possible experience.
