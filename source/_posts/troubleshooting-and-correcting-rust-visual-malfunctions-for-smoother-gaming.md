### Fix 1: Repair system files

 If the fixes above failed to solve the crashes, it might point to a corrupt or missing game file. Many Vanguard players find restoring system files helps them get rid of random crashes. There’re two ways to repair your system files:

1. [**Repair & replace corrupt system files with Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

#### Repair & replace corrupt system files with Fortect

[**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is an all-in-one system solution. It scans your PC’s operating system for viruses, flags dangerous websites, frees up precious disk space, and replaces any problematic files found with new healthy ones. Running a system repair with Fortect is like a clean reinstall of your operating system, and all personal user data, programs, and settings will remain intact.

Here’s how to use Fortect to run a Windows repair:

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Fortect.
2. Fire up Fortect and run a free scan.
3. Once finished, Fortectwill generate a detailed report of your computer health, which includes all issues detected.

 To fix all the issues automatically, click **Start Repair** (You’ll need to purchase the full version. It comes with a 60-day Money-Back Guarantee so you can refund anytime if Fortect doesn’t fix your problem).

4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
5. Check your computer to see if the game still crashes.

 If you run into any problems while using Fortect, or if it doesn’t work for you, don’t hesitate to contact their support team.

#### Run SFC scan

**System File Checker** (**SFC** ) is a handy feature in Windows that helps scan your system files and repair missing or corrupted system files(including those related to **BSOD** ). To **run the SFC scan** :

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key**  and type **cmd** . Then right click on **Command Prompt** and click **Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b28ad73ad4a9.png)
2. Click**Yes** when prompted to confirm.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/img_5b28aee247664.jpg)  
 It’ll take some time for the SFC to replace the corrupted system files with new ones if it detects any, so please be patient.
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
5. Check your computer to see if the game still crashes.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The graphics card is the heart and soul for games like CoD. If Vanguard keeps crashing on your PC, it is likely that the graphics driver on your computer is outdated or corrupt. So you should update your drivers to see if it fixes the game crashing issue.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by going to the manufacturer’s website ([**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) | **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ), finding the latest driver package and installing it step by step. If you don’t have the time or patience to download and install manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all** .

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **[FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/last-scan-never.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1650-super-de-update-all-1.jpg)  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

### Fix 3:**Make sure your PC meets the specs for Vanguard**

 Your game may crash if it doesn’t meet the system requirements for the game. So before attempting anything more advanced, you should compare your system to the officially suggested specifications to see if your PC is powerful enough to run the game.

Here’s how:

 If your PC fails to meet any one of the following requirements, or your hardware component is showing obvious signs of wear and tear, it’s time to upgrade.

| **MINIMUM** SPECIFICATIONS | **RECOMMENDED SPECIFICATIONS**             |                                             |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| **OPERATING SYSTEM**       | Windows 10, 64-Bit                         | Windows 10, 64 Bit / Windows 11, 64 Bit     |
| **CPU**                    | Intel i3-4340 AMD FX-6300                  | Intel Core I5-2500K / Amd Ryzen 5 1600X     |
| **GPU**                    | Nvidia Geforce GTX 960 / AMD Radeon RX 470 | Nvideo Geforce GTX 1060 / AMD Radeon RX 580 |
| **RAM**                    | 8GB                                        | 12GB                                        |
| **Storage**                | 36 GB at launch                            | 61 GB at launch                             |

To check the specs of your PC:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time, then type **dxdiag** and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dxdiag-Run-box.png)
2. Under the **System** tab and you can check the **Operating System**  and **Memory** information on your PC.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dxdiag-diagnostic-tool-1.png)
3. Select the **Display** tab, and you’ll be presented with the information about your **graphics card** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/display-1.png)
4. Close DirectX.

 If your PC specs have been up to the mark but Call of Duty: Vanguard still crashes, please move on to **Fix 4** , below to begin troubleshooting.

### Fix 4: Scan & repair Vanguard game files

 Call of Duty: Vanguard may crash if certain game files are missing or corrupt. To see if this is the case, you should run a scan & repair to verify its integrity. If any files are missing or found damaged, the tool will repair them for you.

1. Open Battle.net client.
2. In the left menu, choose **Call of Duty Vanguard** . Then click **Options**  \> **Scan and Repair** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/scan-and-repair-game-files-1.jpg)
3. Click **Begin Scan** , then wait a while as the tool scans and repairs your game installation.

4. Launch Vanguard again and check to see if the crashing issue still occurs.

### Fix 5: Disable overlays

 The overlay gives you access to features and apps without having to leave the game. However, some players report that the feature could interfere with their gameplay and even block game files.

 If you have enabled the feature on GeForce Experience, Discord, Twitch, or other apps, it’s recommended that you turn them off altogether to see if it mitigates the game crashing problem.

Cod Vanguard crashing still not resolved? Please try Fix 6, below.

### Fix 6: Close background apps

 Another fix you could try is to close unnecessary background apps. This is because third-party apps running in the background may compete for CPU, memory and potentially interfere with the performance of the Vanguard game, causing your game to crash.

 You can kill these resource-hogging and potentially interfering background apps and services via Task Manager:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** **key** , then press **Ctrl** , **Shift,**  and **Esc**  keys at the same time to bring up Task Manager.
2. Select the **Startup**  tab, then right-click on each item and click **Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/123.png)
3. Restart your computer.

4. Test the gameplay in Vanguard and see if the crashing issue is fixed. If yes, congrats! If it’s still no joy, please move on to**Fix 7** , below.

### Fix 7: Make sure your system is up to date

 The game crashing could point to a possible system vulnerability or compatibility issue on your computer. To rule out this as a cause, you can check your system to see if there are any pending updates – if yes, you should let Windows install them all. After that, you can go on to check to see if the crashing issue is put to an end.

Here are the steps:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and type **check for updates** , then click on **Check for updates** as it pops up as a matching result.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/checkforupdates.png)
2. Click **Check for updates** .
