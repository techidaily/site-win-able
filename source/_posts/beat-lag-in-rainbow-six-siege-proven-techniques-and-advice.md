## 1\. Close unnecessary programs

 Programs like browsers, game launchers, anti-virus software are CPU intensive. So if you have them running in the background when playing Splitgate, you’re most likely to suffer from game stutters. To fix that, you should end programs that you don’t need to be running when in-game. But be cautious that you should not end processes that are essential for running Windows, otherwise your computer may fail to work properly.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type**taskmgr** and press Enter.  

![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png)
3. Under the **Processes** tab, right-click on the programs that you don’t necessarily use when playing Splitgate and select **End task** .

 Also, too many startup apps can be a drag on your computer’s performance. Therefore, you should prevent these apps from automatically starting when you sign into Windows:

1. Select the **Startup**  tab. Right-click the apps that you want to stop from running automatically at startup and select **Disable** .  

![disable apps from running automatically at startup](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/startup-disable.png)

 After you’ve done these, play Splitgate. If your problems persist, proceed to the next fix.

## 2\. Delete temp files

 As the name suggests, temporary files are the kind of files that store temporary data that is created by Windows itself or the programs that users use. But they can clog the system drive and slow down your PC. And you wouldn’t be able to enjoy your game to the fullest as there will be input lag or stutters. Therefore, you should delete those temporary files and it won’t cause any problems. Here’s how you can do this:

1. Close all windows.
2. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo +** **R** **keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
3. Type **%temp%** and then press Enter.

4. Press**Ctrl + A** at the same time to select all the files inside the folder. Then right-click and select**Delete** .

5. If the following prompt appears, simply check**Do this for all current items** and click**Skip** .

6. After the files are deleted, go to your desktop and right-click on the **Recycling Bin**  and select **Empty Recycle Bin** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Now you should be able to play your game smoothly. But if it doesn’t work for you, proceed to the next fix.

## 3\. Stop overclocking

 Some players might use overclocking applications such as MSI Afterburner to hopefully get a performance increase. But the truth is that these applications can cause crashes, stutters and other performance issues for some titles. If you suffer from sudden frame rate drops and stutters during Splitgate gameplay, you should stop overclocking.

## 4\. Update your graphics driver

 A driver is an essential piece of software that lets your system communicate with your hardware. If it is outdated or misconfigured, it would cause noticeable performance issues. When you have low FPS or encounter constant stutters during the gameplay, you need to check for graphics driver updates. A new graphics driver comes with bug fixes and brings new features.

 To update your graphics driver, you can either do it manually via the Device Manager or head to the manufacturer’s driver download page to download and install the exact driver for your system. This requires a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an automatic driver updater tool such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as it will take care of the busy work for you.

## 5\. Enable hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling
