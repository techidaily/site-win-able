 Driver Easy will detect the drivers condition in your computer, and install the correct drivers for your PC.

### Fix 5: Turn on VSync

 VSync stands for Vertical Sync, which is a display option in 3D PC games. It allows you to synchronize the frame rate with the monitor refresh rate for better stability. Having VSync on in GTA 5 has been reported by many players to be an effective way to fix the crashing issue.

To do so:

1. Open GTA 5**Settings** .
2. Click**Graphics** and scroll down. Find**VSync** and turn it**ON** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5ba3522a38573.jpg)  
 If it’s already**ON** , try turning it**OFF** , then restart your game and**turn VSync** **on** again.
