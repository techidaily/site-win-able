## Deciphering Silent Dungeons: Solutions for Sound Problems in Skyrim

Playing Skyrim without sound? that’s awful! For a gamer like you, it’s a problem that needs to be fixed. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. This problem can be fixed easily. Read on to find how…

## Check your headset and sound settings

 First, make sure you didn’t mute the sound whether on your computer or your audio playback devices (e.g. headset).

 Second, make sure your audio playback device doesn’t have a problem. You can check it by plugging into another device.

 Third, unplugged your audio playback devices and plugged them back in. This may give you the sound.

 After the above examination, you can determine if the audio playback device has a hardware problem.

 If it has a problem, you need to change it or contact customer service.  
 If not, read on to find how.

## Try these fixes

 Except for hardware issue, the “Skyrim no sound” issue can be caused by software; driver; incorrect settings or the corrupted game files.  
 Before we dig in deeply, let’s try the simplest but most useful way first–**restart your steam and your computer** .  
 If the reboot doesn’t work, let’s try other fixes. You don’t need to try them all, work your way down till find the one that works for you.

1. **[Check your headset software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your audio drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Verify game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Install DirectX from the Skyrim](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Check your headset software

### Fix 2: Update your audio drivers

 It is very important to update your audio drivers. Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version. But with outdated or wrong drivers, you may encounter Skyrim no sound issue. So it’s really important to keep your drivers updating to get better gaming experience.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download audio drivers the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your audio drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.
