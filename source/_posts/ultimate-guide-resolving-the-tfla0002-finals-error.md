### Fix 1: Update your video driver

 The Overwatch stuttering issue could be caused by**an old or corrupted video driver** on your computer. You can update your video driver to the latest version to try to solve the issue.

You can update your video driver either manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update –** You can update your video driver manually by **going to the manufacturer’s website for your video card** , and searching for the most recent correct driver for it. Be sure to choose the only driver that is compatible with your variant of Windows system.

**Automatic driver update –** If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact video card, and your variant of Windows system, and it will download and install it correctly:
