 Don’t end any programs you’re unfamiliar with, as they may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

 If there’re no background programs consuming your CPU but the problem still exists, check out the next fix below.

### Fix 2 – Turn off overlays

 The in-game overlay can also use up your CPU and cause high usage. To disable this feature, follow the instruction that corresponds with your gaming platform: **[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[GOG](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### On Steam

### Fix 5 – Update your device drivers

 Cyberpunk 2077 high usage may occur if the device drivers on your PC are missing or out-of-date. If that’s your case, updating all the drivers could fix your issue.

There are two ways you can update the device drivers correctly:

**Manually** – You can update your device drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically (recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/de-1-1-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). You can also click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.
