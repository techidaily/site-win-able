 After the process completes, you can restart your computer for the changes to take effect. Then, launch FIFA 21 and see if the crashing issue reoccurs. If yes, please continue to the next method.

### Fix 3 â€“ Update your device drivers

 If rolling back the graphics driver doesnâ€™t help, itâ€™s likely that your device drivers are faulty or outdated. To fix the constant FIFA 21 crashes and avoid other potential gaming issues, you should update your device drivers to the latest version.

 You can do this manually by going to the manufacturerâ€™s websites, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-16_12-33-04.jpg)

**4)** After locating the right text, set DIRECTX\_SELECT as below:

* If**DIRECTX\_SELECT = 0** , change**0** to**1**

**5)** Press**Ctrl** and**S** on your keyboard at the same time to save the changes.

 After you apply the settings above, the DirectX error message should be gone and FIFA 21 can run properly. If the game is still unplayable, read on to find more fixes below.

### Fix 6 â€“ Modify the in-game settings

 You may have set high in-game settings for a better visual effect and gaming experience, but if your computer is not powerful enough to cope with that, FIFA 21 will crash. You can try the following lower settings:

**1)** Launch FIFA 21 and click**Game Settings** from the menu.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-16_17-32-34.jpg)

**2)** Set the settings as below:

* **Resolution** : Windowed Borderless
* **Rendering Quality** : Low
* **MSAAOptions** : Off

 So how FIFA 21 works with the new settings? If it still crashes, please check out the next fix.
