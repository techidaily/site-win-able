### Fix 1: Verify integrity of game files

 The Cyberpunk 2077 not launching issue may occur when you have one or more game files corrupted or deleted by malware. To fix this, try verifying the integrity of game files from [**Steam**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or **[Epic Games](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  depending on which platform you’re on.

#### **Verify game files on Steam**

1) Run Steam.

2) Click **LIBRARY** .

 3) Right-click **Cyberpunk 2077** and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-4.jpg)

 4) Click the **LOCAL FILES** tab, then click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3-1.jpg)

5) Relaunch your game to test your issue.

 If your game is still unplayable, move on to [**Fix 2**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### **Verify game files on Epic Games**

1) Open Epic Games Launcher

2) Click **Library** , then click the**Settings icon** next to the game.

4) Relaunch your game to test the issue.

If this doesn’t fix the issue, try the next solution below.

### Fix 2: Temporarily disable anti-virus/overclocking software

 Game launching issues could also be caused by some anti-virus or overclocking software (e.g.**Riva Statistics software, MSI Afterburner** , etc.) interfering with the launch. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable the software if you have any and check if the problem persists.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

If the game is still unplayable, move on to the fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 3: Run as administrator

 If Cyberpunk 2077 doesn’t have permission for certain game files on your system under a standard user mode, it may not run properly. Try this setting to give the program the administrator privileges:

 1) Right-click the Cyberpunk 2077 desktop icon and select Open File Location.

 2) Right-click the **.exe file** and select **Properties** .

 3) Click the **Compatibility** tab and check **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click**OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 If the game still won’t launch with admin privileges, then try the next solution.

### Fix 4: Update the graphics driver

 Your graphics card driver is vital to the gaming experience. If the driver is out of date, it can cause a range of issues, even if your video hardware exceeds the game’s requirements.

 So, you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes the issue. There are two ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 3) Click the**Update** button next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with**full support and a 30-day money back guarantee** . You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![amd 6800 xt driver download](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/amd-6800xt.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

4) Relaunch the game to test your issue.

 If Cyberpunk 2077 still won’t launch, then go ahead with the fix below.

### Fix 5: Update the game launcher

 Game issues could happen when you’re running an outdated game launcher. So if you haven’t updated the game launcher already, try updating it to see if that’s the core issue. If the issue persists, then try the next fix below.
