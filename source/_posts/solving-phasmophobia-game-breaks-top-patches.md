### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Graphics card manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD and Intel constantly release new graphics drivers to fix bugs and improve the gaming performance and experience.

 If the graphics driver on your PC is outdated or corrupted, you may not be able to enjoy the optimal gaming experience, and sometimes you may even run into the NBA 2K20 crash issue.

 **To fix this issue, the first thing you should do is update your graphics driver.** There are two ways that you can update your graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics cards, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. You need the Pro version of Driver Easy to do this, so you’ll be prompted to upgrade.  

 Don’t worry; it comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so if you don’t like it you can get a full refund, no questions asked.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DE-Update-all-drivers.png)  

 (Alternatively if you’re comfortable manually installing drivers, you can click ‘Update’ next to each flagged device in the free version to automatically download the correct driver. Once it’s downloaded, you can manually install it.)

 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 2: Install the latest game patch

 Visual Concepts (the developer of NBA 2K20) releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it. Or maybe this newly released game has not been fully optimized yet, so we need to install patches to optimize the gaming performance and experience.

 If a patch is available, just download and install it to see if it can fix the crashing issue; if there’s no patches available, or if the issue persists after you installed the latest patch, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 3: Perform a Windows Update

 According to the game developers, if MS Visual C++ is missing or corrupted, you may also run into the NBA 2K20 crash issue. To resolve this problem, you need to reinstall the official Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015 and Visual Studio 2017 and .NET Framework.
