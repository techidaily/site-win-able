### Fix 1: Change your power plan

 Windows manages how your PC consumes power with a set of system and hardware settings called power plans. A while ago, a new plan named Ultimate performance was released, and it is said to be designed for high-end PCs. So you can try this and see if there’s any improvements.

1. On your keyboard, press **Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time. Type or paste **powercfg.cpl**  and press **Enter** .

2. Select **Ultimate Performance** . (If you don’t see this power plan, simply continue to the next step to unhide it.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change-power-plan-ultimate-performance.jpg)
3. On your keyboard, press Win (the Windows logo key) and type **cmd** . Select **Run as Administrator** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-cmd-as-administrator.jpg)
4. In the command prompt, type or paste the following command and press **Enter** .  
powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61  
 If you see a prompt similar to this, **return to step 2** to enable the Ultimate Performance power plan.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change-power-plan-cmd-unhide-ultimate-performance.jpg)

Now you can launch Outriders and test the gameplay.

 If the new power plan doesn’t help you, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics driver is one of the many things that determine your gaming experience. You’ll very likely encounter low FPS issues when using a broken or outdated video driver. If you don’t know whether you’re using the latest GPU driver, definitely check it now.

 Both [AMD](https://wccftech.com/amd-radeon-adrenalin-driver-21-3-2/) and [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) have released new drivers that include optimizations for Outriders. See below for driver update instructions.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 If you’re a tech-savvy gamer, you can spend some time updating your GPU driver manually.

To do so, first visit the website of your GPU manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics)**

 Then search for your GPU model. Note that you should only download the latest driver installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to update.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve updated your GPU driver, restart your PC and check if your FPS is up.

 If the latest graphics driver doesn’t help you, simply check out the next solution.

### Fix 3: Install all Windows updates

 To keep your PC running efficiently and securely, it is important to install system updates regularly. Normally it’s a scheduled process, but you can manually check and make sure you’ve got all the patches.

Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open**Windows Settings** . Then click**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/update1.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will start searching for available updates. If there are any, Windows will automatically download and install the updates.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Check-for-updates.png)

 After installing all the updates, do a reboot and check if the FPS has been boosted in Outriders.

### Fix 4: Run Outriders on DirectX 12

 Some gamers reported that running Outriders on DirectX 12 could drastically boost in-game performance, so you might want to try the same and see if it works for you.

If you don’t know how, here’s a quick guide:

1. In your Steam client, navigate to the**LIBRARY** tab. Right click Outriders and select**Properties…**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/outriders-d12-1.jpg)
2. Under the LAUNCH OPTIONS section, click the input box and type or paste**\-force -dx12** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/outriders-d12-2.jpg)
3. Now launch your game and test the gameplay.

 If this method doesn’t solve your issue, simply move on to the next one below.

### Fix 5:**Enable HAGs (Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling)**

 Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling, or HAGs, is a new feature of the Windows 10\. According to NVIDIA and AMD, it can potentially improve performance and reduce latency. If you’re using a   **GeForce 10 series or later/Radeon 5600 or 5700 series graphics card** , you can go right ahead and give this feature a shot.

1. In the empty area of your desktop, right-click and select **Display settings** .

3. Under the **Default settings** section, click **Change default graphics settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hags-3.jpg)
4. Turn on **Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling** .
