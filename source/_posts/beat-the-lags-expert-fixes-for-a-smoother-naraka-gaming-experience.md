## Fix 1: Install the game on SSD

 This might seem a little irrelevant, but it’s recommended to install Naraka Bladepoint on SSD instead of HDD. It was originally suggested by the developer as a fix for crashing issues, but many players have also fixed the lagging issue by doing so.

## Fix 2: Test your internet connection

 Lagging and getting a high ping are network issues, so you should verify your internet connection is reliable and fast enough for gaming. A few things you can do to check your internet connection are:

* Try to **power cycle your router and modem** . First, unplug the power cables from your modem and your router, and leave the cables disconnected for at least 30 seconds. Then plug the cables back into both devices. When your Internet is working again, test if your game still lags.
* Gaming usually**requires a wired connection** , since it’s more stable and faster. If you’re playing Naraka Bladepoint on Wi-Fi, make sure there’s no overcrowding. In other words, **if your Wi-Fi is connected to multiple devices, turn off Wi-Fi on the devices you don’t need to use at the moment.**
* Google “Internet speed test” and pick a tool to**test your Internet speed** . If your Internet connection is unreasonably slow, consider contacting your Internet provider for help.

 If your Internet connection seems fine but the game still lags like crazy, try the next fix.

## Fix 3: Close bandwidth-hogging programs

 Programs running in the background can hog your bandwidth. If you’re streaming or loading videos on your browser, it can also slow your internet connection down, causing connection issues. Here’s how to close these programs:

1. Right-click your taskbar, then click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-29-08.jpg)
2. Under the**Processes** tab, look for the processes that are network-hogging. Right-click it then click**End task** .

If this doesn’t solve your problem, try the next fix.

## Fix 4: Configure DNS settings

 DNS cache is a local database on your PC and allows your browser to retrieve a website’s URL efficiently. Crowded or broken cache can cause connection issues. If you’re experiencing lags in Naraka Bladepoint, you can try to flush your DNS cache and/or switch to a public DNS server. We recommend trying both options:

[1: Flush your DNS](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

[2: Switch to a public DNS server](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### 1: Flush your DNS

 By flushing your DNS, your DNS cache will be cleared. When your PC needs to access a website, it’ll need to obtain the address from the DNS server again. If the DNS cache data was invalid or corrupt, this fix should help solve the lag issues in-game. Here’s how:

1. Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** on your keyboard to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**cmd** , then press**Shift** and**Enter** at the same time. If prompted for permission, click**Yes** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/run-cmd.png)
3. Copy**ipconfig /flushdns** , and paste it in the pop-up window. Then press**Enter** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/flushdns的副本.png)
4. Your DNS cache is successfully cleared.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### 2: Switch to a public DNS server

 We also recommend using a public DNS server to test the issue. We’ll use the Google DNS server as an example, since it’s reliable and secure. Here’s how:

1. On your taskbar, right-click the**network icon** , then click**Open Network & Internet settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/open-network-settings.png)
2. Click**Change adapter options** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/change-adapter-options.png)
3. Right-click**the network you’re using** , then click**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/click-ethernet.png)
4. Select**Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)** , then click**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ipv4.png)
5. Select**Use the following DNS server addresses** , fill in the Google DNS server addresses as below, then click**OK** .  

 **Preferred DNS server: 8.8.8.8**  
 **Alternate DNS server: 8.8.4.4**  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/change-to-google-dns.png)

If this doesn’t give you luck, try the next fix.

## Fix 5: Update your network driver

 If your network driver is outdated or faulty, it could cause stability issues in-game and therefore you may experience extreme lags. It’s important to make sure you’re using the latest network driver. If not, you would need to update it.

 There are two ways you can get the right driver for your network adapter: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update the network adapter driver via Device Manager. Note that Windows may not have the latest available driver, and you may need to visit the manufacturer’s website to search for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only the driver that’s compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact network adapter and your Windows version, then it will download and install it correctly:

 1) [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/1-5.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged network driver to automatically download the correct version of the driver, then you can manually install them (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-01-04.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Restart your PC for the new drivers to take effect. Run a game to see if the problem persists.

## Fix 6: Install all Windows updates

 Keeping your system up-to-date can solve or at least prevent some compatibility issues which cause the lag issues in-game. Make sure that you always install the available updates. Here’s how:

1. In the search bar next to your Start button, type**update** , then click C**heck for updates** .  
 (If you don’t see the search bar, click the Start button and you’ll find it in the pop-up menu.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/check-for-updates.png)
2. Windows will scan for any available updates. If there are_no_ available updates, you’ll get a**You’re up to date** sign. You could also click**View all optional updates** and install them if needed.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/up-to-date.png)
3. If there are available updates, Windows will automatically download them for you. Follow instructions to complete the installation if needed.

4. Restart your PC to let it take effect.

 If this doesn’t solve your problem, there’s one more fix you can try.

## Fix 7: Lower in-game settings

 Lowering in-game graphics settings can reduce lags. It’s usually the last resort players will turn to when their PC actually can handle higher demands. Ping issues in Naraka are yet to be fixed by the developer, and until that, you can try this workaround.
