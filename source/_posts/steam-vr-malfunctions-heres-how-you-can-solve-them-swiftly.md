## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is essential for the proper functioning of video games, also for your VR set. If Phasmophobia VR is not working, you may need to check if your graphics driver is up-to-date.

 There are two ways to keep your graphics card driver up-to-date. One is to manually update it[via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

1. Launch Steam and find Phasmophobia in your library. Right-click the game and select**Properties** .

3. Steam will now scan your local game folders and compare the files with the ones on the server. If anything is broken or missing, Steam will fix it for you. This process may take a while.

## Fix 4: Launch the game from VR software

 Some players reported that launching Phasmophobia from SteamVR has caused issues such as VR crashing and black screen issues. As a workaround, you can try to launch Phasmophobia from the VR software, for example, you can launch the game from Oculus software.

 It’s also recommended to leave the VR software running in the background even if you’re launching the game from SteamVR.

 If this doesn’t fix the problem, there’s one more fix you can try.

## Fix 5: Update your VR software

 It’s also possible that the issue is with your VR software, not with the game. VR software provides essential features for your VR set to work smoothly on your PC. When your VR set is not working on Phasmophobia, try updating the VR software to ensure compatibility.
