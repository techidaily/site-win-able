### Fix 1: Make sure your specs meet the requirements

 VR games tend to be graphically demanding, not to mention this long anticipated AAA title. So before you can fully experience the well-crafted dystopia in Half Life: Alyx, first you need to make sure your gaming rig meets the minimum requirements. Because if it doesn’t, then maybe it’s time for an upgrade.

#### Minimum requirements for Half Life: Alyx

| **OS:**        | Windows 10                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Processor:** | Core i5-7500 / Ryzen 5 1600  |
| **Memory:**    | 12 GB RAM                    |
| **Graphics:**  | GTX 1060 / RX 580 – 6GB VRAM |

 If your specs are more than capable for the game, simply continue to the next fix below.

### Fix 2: Change your power plan

 Power plan is a scheme that manages the way your PC consumes energy. The recent Windows build introduces a new power plan called Ultimate Performance, which provides a certain level of performance boost. You can start from here when troubleshooting stuttering issues.

Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press **Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time. Type or paste **powercfg.cpl**  and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cmd-run-power-option.jpg)
2. Select **Ultimate Performance** . If you don’t see this power plan, simply continue to the next step to unhide it.

4. In the command prompt, type or paste the following command and press **Enter** .  
powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61  
 If you see a prompt similar to this, **return to step 2** to enable the Ultimate Performance power plan.

 After changing your power plan, launch Half Life: Alyx and test the gameplay.

 If this trick doesn’t give you luck, you can take a look at the next one.

## Fix 3: Disable overlays

 In-game overlays allow you to interact with friends and place orders while you’re enjoying the game. But this handy feature might also be an interference to performance according to some. So if you’re using overlays such as**Steam** or**Discord** , try disabling them and see how it goes.

And here’s how to turn off Steam overlays:

After disabling all the overlays, check if Half Life: Alyx lags again.

 If this fix doesn’t help you, simply move on to the next one below.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 In most cases, the lag and stuttering simply means you’re using**a** **faulty or outdated graphics driver** . Manufacturers keep updating their drivers so as to deliver the best possible performance. If the last time you updated your drivers feels like ages ago, definitely do it now as it might save your day.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the graphics manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), finding the latest correct installer for your model and installing the driver step by step. But if you don’t like playing with computer drivers, you can update automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/last-scan-never.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2060-super-update.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve updated your GPU driver, restart your PC and test your gameplay.

 If the latest driver doesn’t do the trick, you can continue to the next method.

1. On your keyboard, press **Win** (the Windows logo key). At the bottom left corner of your screen, click the**gear icon** to open Settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-gear-icon.jpg)
2. Scroll down and select**Update & Security** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update-2.jpg)
4. Click**Check for updates** . Then wait for the process to complete. After that, restart your PC.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** again.

 After installing all the updates, do a reboot and see if Half Life: Alyx lags again.

If this method failed to fix the lag, you can try the next one below.

### Fix 6: Set additional launch options

 Some players reported that they managed to fix the stuttering by adding launch parameters, so you can try the same as it could be a potential fix.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Steam Library.
2. Right click**Half Life: Alyx** and select**Properties…** .

3. Under the LAUNCH OPTIONS section, click the input area and type or paste the code below. Then close the window to save the changes.
