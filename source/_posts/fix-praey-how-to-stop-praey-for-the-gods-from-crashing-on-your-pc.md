### Fix 1: Install the latest game patch

 Recently, the Gas Station Simulator developer has released a new hotfix that resolves random crashes while playing. The developer has acknowledged that Texture Streaming was responsible for a significant amount of random crashes in various circumstances. Those crashes have been fixed in the latest update. So before you try anything more complicated,**make sure you have installed the latest game patch** .

 If the game still keeps crashing after installing the latest update, check out the next fix.

### Fix 2: Verify the integrity of game files

 If there are any missing or corrupted game files, you’re more likely to encounter crashing issues with your game. To fix it, you can scan and repair your game files via Steam. Here’s how:

1. Go to your Steam**Library** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/steam-library-1.jpg)
2. Right-click**Gas Station Simulator** and select**Properties…** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steam-verify-game-files-1.jpg)
4. Steam will verify the game’s files. This process may take several minutes.

Once done, relaunch the game and check if your problem is resolved.

If the crashing issue persists, continue to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Run the game as administrator

 Some programs need administrator rights to function properly on your PC. To ensure that Gas Station Simulator has the full rights it needs, you can run this game as an administrator. Here’s how:

1. **Right-click** the executable file of Gas Station Simulator and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/properties.jpg)

 Once you have done this, restart Steam and try launching the game again to see if your problem has been resolved.

If the crashing issue remains, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is essential to the functioning of video games. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, you’re more likely to encounter the crashing issue in Gas Station Simulator. To fix the potential problem and get the best performance, you should always **ensure you have the latest drivers for your graphics card installed** .

 One way to do that is to visit the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ) and search for your model, then download and install the latest graphics driver manually. But if you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, then it will download and install them correctly:

### Fix 5: Check your antivirus settings

 Some antivirus programs could block your game from running and cause the game to crash. To see if that’s the case for you, you can temporarily disable your antivirus.

 If Gas Station Simulator stops crashing after you disable the antivirus, you’ll need to whitelist Steam and the game. This process will vary depending on the antivirus software you’re using.

 But if the game remains crashing after disabling your antivirus, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

 The programs running in the background could interfere with your game. To fix it, you can perform a clean boot to figure out if the crash was caused due to a software conflict. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type**msconfig** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/msconfig.jpg)
2. In System Configuration, navigate to the**Services** tab and check the box next to**Hide all Microsoft services** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/hide-all-microsoft-services.jpg)
3. **Uncheck** all the services EXCEPT those belong to your video card or sound card manufacturer, such as**Realtek** ,**AMD** ,**NVIDIA** and**Intel** . Then click**OK** to save the changes.
