 Before you try anything more complicated, please make sure your computer is up to handling graphics-intensive games like Days Gone. Otherwise, you’ll need to perform a hardware upgrade to play the game.

 For your reference, here is a guide on[how to check your computer specs](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

**The minimum system requirements:**

| **OS**        | Windows 10 64-bits                                        |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor** | Intel Core <i5-2500K@3.3GHz> or AMD FX <6300@3.5GHz>          |
| **Memory**    | 8 GB RAM                                                  |
| **Graphics**  | Nvidia GeForce GTX 780 (3 GB) or AMD Radeon R9 290 (4 GB) |
| **DirectX**   | Version 11                                                |

**The recommended system requirements:**

| **OS**        | Windows 10 64-bits                                         |

| **DirectX**   | Version 11                                                 |

 Once you’ve confirmed your rig meets the requirements, move on to more fixes advanced.

### Fix 1 – Stop overclocking

 You may expect that overclocking your CPU and GPU can give a boost in the game performance, but it sometimes comes at the cost of system stability. To fix Days Gone crashing, try **turning off overclocking utilities** like MSI Afterburner and **setting the clock speed back to the default** , and then see how things go. If the problem persists, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is important to your gaming experience with Days Gone. If the graphics driver is wrong, faulty or outdated, you may get constant crashes during the gameplay. So, make sure your graphics driver is up to date. If not, definitely update it right now.

 You can search for the latest graphics driver from your graphics card’s manufacturer **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , and then manually install it. But if you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 steps:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). Or you can click**Update** to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.

### Fix 3 – Verify integrity of game files

 If certain game files are missing or damaged, the game will fail to run smoothly and crashes can occur. To see if that’s the cause, you could do an integrity check with your game launcher: **[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[Epic Games Store](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### If you’re playing on Steam

1. Launch Steam and navigate to the**Library** tab.

3. Select the**Local Files** tab and click**Verify integrity of game files** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/steam-verify-game-files-1.jpg)

#### If you’re playing on Epic Games Store

1. Open the Epic Games Launcher and select the**Library** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/epic-1-1.jpg)

<a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BConverter%2BBox"><img src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/8020c1dc-518e-3bdf-6e7b-e6d1bdf1597b.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4 – Turn off overlays

 The overlay can also be a possible cause of Days Gone crash. So if you’re using any apps such as[**Steam**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or **[GeForce Experience](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  with an in-game overlay feature, disable them all to see how the game works. Here are the steps:

#### On Steam

1. Start the Steam client and go to the**Library** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-game-files-steam.jpg)
2. Right-click**Days Gone** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-1-1.jpg)
3. On the**General** tab, untick**Enable Steam overlay while in-game** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-steam-overlay.jpg)

#### On GeForce Experience

1. Run GeForce Experience.
2. Click the **cogwheel icon** at the upper right corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/7-1-1.jpg)
3. Toggle off **In-game overlay** .
