### Fix 1: Verify the integrity of game files

 Broken or missing game files could lead to constant crashes. So before you try anything else, first make sure there’s nothing wrong with the game files.

Here’s how to do that on Origin:

1. Open your Origin client. In the left pane, click**My Game Library** .

Once done, launch Madden 21 and check if it crashes again.

If the fix doesn’t stop the crash, you can try the next one below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 In most cases, game crashes are graphics related. In other words, the constant crashes could indicate you’re using a**buggy or outdated graphics driver** . New drivers usually tackle compatibility issues, so always make sure you’re using the latest graphics driver.

 Of course you can update your drivers manually: first go to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), then search, download and install the driver step by step. But if you don’t like fiddling with device drivers, you can leave it to[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . It’s a tool that detects, downloads and installs any driver updates your computer needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/last-scan-never.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![Update graphics drivers with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating the latest graphics driver, restart your PC and test the gameplay in Madden 21.

 If the latest graphics driver doesn’t help, you can take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 3: Install all Windows updates

![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then download and install the available patches. It might take some time (up to 30 mins).  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To confirm you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

 If you’re sure your system is up to date, simply check out the next trick below.

1. Launch Madden NFL 21\. At the bottom right corner, click the gear icon and select**SETTINGS** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/madden-21-directx-1.jpg)

3. Select**GRAPHICS** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/madden-21-directx-3.jpg)
4. Click to change DIRECTX VERSION. Then save the changes and restart the game.

### Fix 5: Lower in-game graphical settings

 There’s also feedback showing that low graphics settings could help make the game stable. You can do the same and fine-tune the settings if it stops crashing.

You can start with these settings:

* Lower the game resolution to under**1920×1080**
* Lock the FPS at**30**
* Turn off**Antialiasing**
* Turn off**Bloom** and**3D Grass** (or disable all special effects)

Once done, restart your game and test the improvement.
