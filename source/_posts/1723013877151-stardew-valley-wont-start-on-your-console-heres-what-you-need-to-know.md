**Graphics drivers** act as a bridge that allows your operating system and applications, such as Starfield, to interact effectively with your graphics hardware.

 When Starfield or any other game fails to launch, outdated or incompatible graphics drivers can often be a leading cause of the problem. To ensure that your system is equipped with the latest software to support your game’s requirements, enhance performance, and maintain compatibility, you should**update your graphics drivers** .

## 2\. Update Windows

 To ensure Starfield opens without interruptions, it’s crucial to keep your Windows updated. Windows updates often include bug fixes, make sure your system is compatible with application requirements, and enhance system stability, reducing conflicts that can hinder game launches.

To download and install the latest Windows updates, take these steps:

### On Windows 11

## 3\. Disable antivirus and firewall

 Your firewall and antivirus are diligent gatekeepers, which is great for overall security. However, they can occasionally misinterpret Starfield’s actions as threats. By turning them off briefly, you can check if they’re blocking the game’s launch.

 _Note: Only disable them temporarily for testing, and remember to re-enable them afterward. Otherwise, your system could be put at risk._

To temporarily disable the Windows Firewall:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type or paste **control firewall.cpl** and hit Enter.

## 4\. Verify the integrity of game files (Steam users)

 Over time, your game files can become corrupted, incomplete, or missing, causing issues such as Starfield not launching, crashing on startup, or various errors.

1. Launch Steam.
2. Either right-click your game in your Library or click on the gear icon from the game’s Library page on the far right.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/how-to-verify-the-integrity-of-game-files-on-Starfield.png)
5. Steam will verify the game’s files – this process may take several minutes. When the process is complete, try to launch Starfield and see if it works.

## 5\. Update the Xbox and Gaming Services apps

 Keeping your Xbox and Gaming Services apps updated should significantly enhance your overall gaming experience.

Follow the steps below to do this.

1. On the taskbar, press the**Start** button. Then type**store** , find the Microsoft Store app, and open it.
2. Select**Library** .
3. Under**Updates & download** , check if there are any updates available for the Xbox app or Gaming Services app. If an update is available, select**Update** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Starfield-on-the-game-launcher-1200x675.jpg)

 For Xbox users, you should also check if the services are up and running. Sometimes the issue is not on your end.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Uninstall and reinstall the game

 If none of the above methods work, you should consider uninstalling and reinstalling the game.

 After having the latest version of Starfield installed on your system, launch it and see if you can get into the gameplay.

 However, if you still have difficulty launching Starfield, try this last resort – run a full scan on your PC. Your issue may be**due to the corruption of your system files** .

 To make sure those files are intact, you can use the **System File Checker** (SFC), a utility in Windows that helps check any problematic files and repair them if there are any. Below is the simple step-by-step guide.

1. In the search box on the taskbar, type **cmd** . Find Command Prompt from the list of results and right-click it. Then select **Run as administrator** .
2. Click **Yes**  when you receive a prompt.
3. Copy and paste the following commands in Command Prompt, then press Enter.  

`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`
4. Wait until you see a message saying “The operation completed successfully.”

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/how-to-run-the-system-file-checker.jpg)
5. Now type **sfc /scannow**  and press Enter. Then it’ll start scanning the integrity of all protected operating system files and replace incorrect, corrupted, changed, or damaged versions with the correct versions.  

 When you see a message that says “Verification 100% complete”, type**exit** and press Enter.
