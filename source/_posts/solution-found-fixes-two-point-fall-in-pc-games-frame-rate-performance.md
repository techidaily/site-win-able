 After you disable any overlays in-use, restart Nioh 2 to see if it performs better now. If not, proceed to the next method.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 Graphics card driver matters a lot to your gaming performance. If you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver, Nioh 2 FPS drop is likely to occur. GPU manufacturers will regularly optimize their drivers for the latest titles. So if you expect smooth gameplay with high and steady FPS, you should keep your graphics driver up-to-date.

There are two ways you can update the driver:

**Option 1 – Manually** – If you know the exact model of your graphics card, you can go straight to the manufacturer’s website: **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  . Then search for the most recent driver that’s compatible with your operating system and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-1.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)
