 Do you want to add percentages in Excel? There are a few ways to do this. In one sense, you could be talking about adding percentage values. Or, you could be looking for a way to add a 15% increase to a value. We'll take a look at both.

##  How to Add Percentages Together

 You can add percentages like any other number. Choose a cell to display the sum of your two percentages. In this example, we're going to click and highlight cell C3.

 In the formula bar, type "=sum" (without quotes) and then click the first result, the sum formula, which adds all numbers in a range of cells.

 Click in cell A3 and then command click cell B3 to select both. If you have more cells, you can click the first and then Shift + Click the last to select all cells in a range.

 Once your chosen cells are highlighted, hit "Enter" on the keyboard, or press the checkmark in the formula bar to execute the formula and display the sum of your percentages.

##  How to Apply a Percentage Increase

 If you actually want to add a percentage to a number---adding 15% to 200, for example---then this example is what you're looking for. It's worth noting that you can do the formula in reverse (taking 15% off of 200) by changing the "+" sign to a "-" sign in the formula below.

 Insert your two figures in columns A and B. A, in our example, will be the whole number, while B will be our percentage.

 Click the empty cell next to your percentage to tell Excel where we'll be displaying the result of our formula.

 We're going to apply a formula that tells Excel to take 15% of 83 (or 12.45) and add it to our original number (83). This will give us the desired result, a 15% increase, or 94.45\. You can add the following formula to an empty cell, or the formula bar:

=A3+(A3*B3)
