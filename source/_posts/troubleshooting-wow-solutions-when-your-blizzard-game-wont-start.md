### Fix 1: Restart your PC

 If you’re running multiple programs on your PC, chances are one or more programs are conflicting with_Crusader Kings 2_ or your game launcher, causing this issue for you. In this case, try restarting your computer to turn off unnecessary programs completely, then restart your game to test your issue.

 Many players manage to fix the_Crusader Kings 2_ launching issue by turning off**Nvidia Geforce Experience** and**EVGA Precision X** . If you have either of the two programs on your PC, please turn the program off during gameplay.

 If your problem still exists after the reboot, move on to the next fix below.

### Fix 2: Run the game as an administrator

**1)** Exit**Crusader Kings 2** and **Steam**  completely.

**2)**  Right-click **Steam**  and select **Properties** .

### Fix 3: Verify the integrity of your game files

 If your game still won’t launch at all, you may have one or more corrupted game files that are conflicting with the game. Try verifying the integrity of your game files to see if that’s the core issue. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)** Click **LIBRARY**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-25_10-39-20.jpg)

**3)**  Right-click**Crusader Kings 2** and select **Properties** .

**4)** Click the **LOCAL FILES** tab, then click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_14-20-58.jpg)

**5)** Relaunch your game to test your issue.

If your game still won’t launch, then go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 This issue is likely to occur if you’re using the wrong graphics driver or it’s out of date. So, you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes your issue. There are two ways you can do this:

* [**Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [**Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 The manufacturer of your graphics card keeps updating the driver. To get the latest correct driver, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**3)** Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-22_12-00-59-1.jpg)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact Driver Easy’s support team at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Relaunch your game to test your issue after updating your graphics driver. If your game is still unplayable, read on and try the fix below.
