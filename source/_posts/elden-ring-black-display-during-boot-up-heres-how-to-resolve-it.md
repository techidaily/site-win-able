3. **[Update your graphics driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Launch the game in windowed mode

 Some players found that starting the game in windowed mode may fix the black screen issue in Elden Ring. When your game is running, you can press**Alt+Enter** at the same time to switch between the windowed mode and full-screen mode. If this doesn’t work, you can try setting launch options in Steam. Here’s how:

1. Open your Steam Library.
2. Right-click**Elden Ring** and select**Properties…** .

3. On the**General** tab, you’ll find the**Launch Options** section. Then enter the following parameters to open the game in windowed mode:  
**\-windowed**

4. Close the**Properties** window and launch the game.

 If the black screen occurs again, don’t worry. There are still other fixes you can try.

### Fix 2: Restart your graphics driver

 When you get a black screen on your Windows PC, you can try using the keyboard shortcut**Windows logo key + Ctrl + Shift + B** to restart your graphics driver. If Windows is responsive, your screen will flash and then the game should work fine. But if not, go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 The black screen issue may occur if you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver. To see if that’s the case, you should update your graphics driver to the latest version. This may not only fix the potential problem but also improve your game performance.

There are mainly two ways to update your graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](http://www.amd.com/drivers) or[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) ) for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with Driver Easy. Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to upgrade to the Pro version, you can also update your drivers with the FREE version. All you need to do is download them one at a time and manually install them.)

 Once you’ve updated your graphics driver, restart your PC and launch Elden Ring again to see if your problem is resolved.
