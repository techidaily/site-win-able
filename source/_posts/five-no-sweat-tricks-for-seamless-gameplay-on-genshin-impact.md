5. Once the process is complete, restart your computer.

 If Windows doesn’t find a new driver, you can try looking for one from your graphics card manufacturer’s website or by using a third-party driver updater.

### Method 2: Update graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.**Driver Easy handles it all.**
