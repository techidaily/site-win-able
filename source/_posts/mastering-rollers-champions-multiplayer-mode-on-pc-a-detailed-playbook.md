## Fix 2: Update your driver

 The black screen issue usually relates to the PC’s graphics card and graphics driver. If the graphics driver on your PC is outdated or corrupted, there might be crashes, black screen, lags and etc.

 Graphics card manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD constantly release new drivers to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. Therefore, updating your driver would be the fix for many issues.

There are two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 A**utomatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics cards, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

## Fix 3: Edit P5S file

 Edit the configure file might be a solution for some players. We highly recommend you**back up the file** you’re about to edit so that you can restore it when there’re certain issues appear.

1. Press the Windows key + R together to open the Run box.
2. Type**%%APPDATA%\\SEGA\\Steam\\P5S\\** and click**OK** .
3. Open**config.xml** .
4. Edit the file by replacing **<DisplaySetting>1</DisplaySetting>** to **<DisplaySetting>3</DisplaySetting>** (1 to 3) .
5. Save the change.

## Fix 4: Change NVIDIA settings

 If you have an NVIDIA card on your PC, you can use this fix. Make sure Previously, the game would ONLY work in Windowed mode for me, and I would constantly get the infinite loading black screen. This guide is for those with Nvidia cards only.

1. Open Nvidia Control Panel.
2. Hit**Manage 3D settings > Program Settings** .
3. Select Persona 5 Strikers from the drop-down menu.
4. Select**High-performance NVIDIA processor** .
5. Click **Apply** to save changes.
6. Reboot the game to check.
