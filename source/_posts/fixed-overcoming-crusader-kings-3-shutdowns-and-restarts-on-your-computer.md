## Fix 1 – Restart your computer

 Yes, seriously. Just turn off your computer and turn it back on. The game crash issue is sometimes just a temporary problem that can be fixed by a restart.

 But if your game keeps crashing even after the restart, try the next solution below.

## Fix 2 – Disconnect peripherals

 Your peripherals, especially gaming accessories, often run with 3rd party software that controls them. In some cases, the software may not be compatible with your game and prevent it from running correctly.

 If you have multiple peripherals hooked up to your computer, try disconnecting them to find out if any is causing trouble for you.

## Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 The graphics processing unit (GPU), or your graphics card, has the most impact on your gameplay experience. And your graphics driver is essential for getting top performance from your GPU. If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, it could result in game glitches and long rendering time. So try updating your graphics driver and then running the game again.

 You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, (such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en)**  , [**Intel**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/homepage.html) or **[Nvidia](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ,) and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

**4)**  Relaunch the game to test your issue.

If Disco Elysium still crashes, try the next fix below.

## Fix 4 – Disable extraneous software

 Game performance issues will happen when your game is unable to gain access to the memory it needs. So, it’s always wise to close background programs that take up a lot of PC memory when playing games.

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Ctrl, Shift and Esc keys** at the same time to open Task Manager.

**2)** Right-click the programs you want to close and select **End Task** .

 Don’t close any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**3)** Restart your game to see if it runs correctly now.

 You may also need to disable your antivirus as game crashes is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. If your game works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

If Disco Elysium won’t work correctly, read on and try Fix 5.

## Fix 5 – Verify integrity of game files

 Files of your game installation might get corrupt, or be deleted as a false positive by antivirus. This could cause issues such as crashes during gameplay.

 To fix corrupted game files, you can have Steam validate the game files on your system. Steam will examine your game files and restore the corrupted files from Steam servers if any problems are detected.

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)** Click **LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2020-02-14_17-15-17.jpg)

**3)** Right-click **Disco Elysium – The Final Cut** and select **Properties** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**4)** Click the **LOCAL FILES** tab, then click **VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES** .

 This could take several minutes. Wait for the process to be complete.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-09_10-38-34.jpg)

**5)**  Relaunch Disco Elysium.

If your game still crashes after this, try the fix below.

## Fix 6 – Stop overclocking

 If you’re overclocking your CPU or GPU, stop it. An unstable overclock will crash your game and the whole system. So, you should set your CPU clock speed rate back to the default to see if that resolves the crash issue.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Fix 7 – Reinstall the game

 If your game is not properly installed on your PC or if your game version is outdated, you’re likely to run into issues like game crashes. Try reinstalling your game to see if that’s the problem for you:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)** Click **LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-25_10-39-20-3.jpg)

**3)**  Right-click **Disco Elysium – The Final Cut** , and select **Manage > Uninstall** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2019-11-25_11-20-09-edited.jpg)

**4)** Restart Steam and reinstall the game.

**5)** Relaunch your game.

If the crashing issue still exists, there’s still 1 fix to try.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Fix 8: Check for Windows updates

 If your game won’t launch at all, it’s not likely that out-of-date Windows components are the core issue, but you should rule out the possibility.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key. Then, type **windows update** and select **Windows Update settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-01-18_11-12-20.jpg)

 2) Click **Check for updates,**  and then wait for Windows to download and install the updates automatically.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-01-18_11-12-44.jpg)

**3)**  Restart your computer and your game.

If the game still crashes, then try the next solution.

## Fix 9 – Run as administrator

 Running your computer under a standard user mode can give a hard time to gameplay as limited user rights may cause problems when your game tries to access certain game files.

To run your game as administrator, follow the instructions below:

 1) Right-click the**Disco Elysium desktop icon** and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-16_16-59-37.jpg)

 2) Click the **Compatibility** tab and check **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2020-12-16_17-00-12.jpg)

4) Repeat steps 1-2 to grant Steam admin rights.

5) Relaunch the game to see if it works now.
