### Fix 3: Add Discord to the whitelist of your third-party antivirus application

 If you’re using a third-party antivirus application on your PC, you may encounter the**Discord overlay** not working issue. Your third-party antivirus application may interfere with**Discord** , so your **Discord overlay** may not run as expected. You can try   **adding your Discord to the whitelist of your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.

### Fix 4: Check for software interruption

 Maybe the**Discord overlay** not working issue is also triggered by the interruption from other applications running on your PC. Try**temporarily disabling them** to see if your**Discord overlay** works or not. If you’re running**the programs that have the overlay features** , or you’re running**the programs that can access your microphone** , they may interfere with your**Discord overlay** .

**Programs like screen recorders**  are most likely to interfere with your **Discord overlay** .

### Fix 5: Disable hardware acceleration in Discord

 Hardware acceleration is a feature in**Discord** that uses your GPU to make**Discord** smoother. However, many users have reported that sometimes, this feature may cause the**Discord overlay** to not work.

 If you turned on the hardware acceleration feature in**Discord** and the**Discord overlay** does not work issue occurs, try**disabling hardware acceleration in Discord** . Follow the instructions below to check whether you turned on the hardware acceleration feature or not:

 1) Open your**Discord** , Click **the gear button** to open **User Settings** .

### Bonus tip: How to fix Discord connection errors?

 It’s very frustrating to run into the voice connection issue when playing the game. But don’t worry, most voice connection errors can be fixed by configuring a VPN connection.

 Please note that **Discord only works on VPNs that have UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** . If you’re not sure which VPN service you should choose, here we recommend**NordVPN** to you.

 NordVPN helps you set up a fast, stable, and secure Internet connection anywhere. And it helps you do this with just a few clicks or taps! What’s more, with one NordVPN account, you can set up a VPN connection on all devices. NordVPN allows you to connect up to 6 devices at the same time!

#### To Set up a VPN connection on your Windows PC

 1) Before visiting the official website of NordVPN, **get a[NordVPN coupon code](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) first!** Then head to[the official website of NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Follow the steps on its web page to**select your plan** and**create your NordVPN account** .

 2) On your Windows PC, visit **[the NordVPN download page](https://nordvpn.com/download/windows/)**  to download and install it.

 3) Launch NordVPN. Enter your NordVPN account and password, then click**Sign In** .
