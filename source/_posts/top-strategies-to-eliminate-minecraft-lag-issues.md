PC game lagging happens a lot and unexpectedly on your Windows, but the good news is that this can be easily solved. For Rainbow Six Siege lag, in particular, we’ve put together some fixes that have helped other players.

## Check your PC specs first

 No matter what kind of game issues you’re facing, you’d better check your PC specs first to see if your PC meets the minimum requirements of Rainbow Six Siege. Although Rainbow Six Seige is a pretty old game, released in 2015, it has a fairly high demand for your RAM.

 A quick way to check your PC specs: type**dxdiag** in the Windows search bar, and press**Enter** .

#### Minimum Requirements

| **Operating System** | Windows 10 (64-bit versions)                                           |

| **DirectX**          | 11                                                                     |

#### Recommended requirements

| **Operating System** | Windows 10 (64-bit versions)                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Processor**        | AMD FX-8120 @ 3.1 GHz, Intel Core i5-2500K @ 3.3 GHz, or better    |
| **RAM**              | 8 GB                                                               |

**Note:** Rainbow Six Siege conflicts with MSI Afterburner,_S_ LI, and Crossfire, so you’d better close or uninstall them. It’s also helpful to kill Discord for it eats up a lot of CPU. What’s more, remember not to overclock your PC.

### Fix 1: Update your device drivers

 First, make sure you have the latest graphics driver, sound card driver, and network driver installed, especially the graphics driver, for an outdated driver of these three devices can deliver a really unhappy gaming experience.

 Manufacturers like NVIDIA and AMD keep releasing new graphics card drivers designed for lately released games, and also for old games to improve performance and fix bugs. Therefore, you may need to check for updates in[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) or[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) and install the latest driver every time your game lags, crashes, or freezes.

 Besides manually updating your driver, you can**do it automatically** with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  if you don’t have the time or patience to do that yourself.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 Plus, you can perform a driver backup, driver restore, and driver, uninstall easily with its additional tools.

#### How to update drivers with Driver Easy?

### Fix 2: Lower your game settings

 Adjust your graphics settings to see if the performance picks up a little. This is not a guaranteed fix, but it is worth a try.

**1\. Important graphics settings**

| Texture Quality   | Medium or Low (if you have a low FPS) |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Texture Filtering | Linear                                |

**2\. Unnecessary graphic settings**

* Set the following options to**LOW** :

| LOD Quality        | LOW |
| ------------------ | --- |
| Shadow Quality     | LOW |
| Shading Quality    | LOW |
| Reflection Quality | LOW |

 However, it’s not recommended to set your Shadow Quality to low or off, or you won’t be able to see people’s shadows. You can set it to medium instead if you do need this feature. Don’t go higher, because the sad truth is that it can make your game slow.

* Set the following options to**OFF** :

| Ambient Occlusion          | OFF |
| -------------------------- | --- |
| Lens Effects               | OFF |
| Zoom-In Depth of Field     | OFF |
| Multisample Anti-Aliasing  | OFF |
| Post-Process Anti-Aliasing | OFF |

 Settings like antialiasing and ambient occlusion for example can reduce your framerate significantly. If you feel your game is choppy, try turning them off.

### Fix 3: Disable fullscreen optimization

 Fullscreen optimization is a blend between borderless and fullscreen. This feature might be the culprit causing the Rainbow Six Siege to lag. Here’s how to disable it:

1) Go to the directory where you installed your Rainbow Six Siege.

**Note:** If you’re not sure where it is, you can run**Task Manager** (Ctrl + Shift + Esc) and go to the**Details** tab when the game is still running. Right-click your .exe game file and select**Open file location** .

 2) Right-click your Rainbow Six Siege.exe file and select**Properties** .

 3) Go to the**Compatibility** tab and tick the box**Disable fullscreen optimization** and also**Run this program as an administrator** .

 4) Click**Apply** \>**OK** .

### Fix 4: Change CPU priority to High

 Changing priority to high helped many players fix their Rainbow Six: Siege lag issues. Here’s how to do it:

 1) While the game is running, press**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** at the same time to open Task Manager.

 2) Go to the**Details** tab and locate your Rainbow Six: Siege.exe. Right-click the main .exe file and move over to**Set priority** , then select**High** .

 3) Confirm the change if you’re prompted for permission.

 4) If this doesn’t work for you, select the .exe file in the Task Manager and select**Set Affinity** , then uncheck the box**CPU 0** and click**OK** .

### Fix 5: Turn on V-Sync in game

 V-Sync helps synchronize your game’s screen refresh rate to the specifications of the monitor. Since most people prefer to turn off V-Sync in-game it does fix some major issues sometimes.

 For Rainbow Six Siege, however, if you’re experiencing serious lag or stuttering, you can try turning it on instead. Some gamers find turning on V-Sync in the Display settings to fix their lagging or stuttering issues.

### Fix 6: Limit Rainbow Six Siege FPS

 Rainbow Six Siege has a built-in FPS cap that can be accessed by the**GameSettings.ini** which is located in your Rainbow Six folder under your My Games folder.

Here is how to find the setting files for Rainbow Six Siege:

 1) Go to**%USERPROFILE%\\Documents\\My Games\\**

 2) Select**Rainbow Six Siege** , and you will see a string of random code which is your ID. Inside this folder is**GameSettings.ini** .

 3) Open the setting file and locate**\[DISPLAY\]**

 4) Set**FPSLImit** to**60** .

`[DISPLAY]  
 FPSLimit => Limit the game's fps. Minimum of 30fps. Anything below will disable the fps limit.  
 Brightness=75.000000  
 FPSLimit=60`

### Fix 7: Repair Visual C++ Redistributable Packages

 The chances are that outdated, missing, or corrupted Visual C++ Redistributable Packages are causing the Rainbow Six Siege lagging issue. Games that are programmed through C++ rely heavily on these files, therefore you can troubleshoot the lagging issues by updating to the latest C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio.

 You can go to the Microsoft official website for **[the latest supported Visual C++ downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)**  .

 After reinstalling, try playing your game again to see if the lagging issue still bothers you. If the annoying lag persists, you can try the next fix.

### Fix 8: Delete temp files

 Deleting your temp files can effectively help you free up disk storage and reduce your PC lag, therefore fixing your Rainbow Six Siege issue.

 1) Copy & paste**%temp%** into the File Explorer address bar and press**Enter** .

 2) Press**Ctrl + A** to select all the temporary files and press**Delete** .

**Note:** Some files may not be able to be deleted. If you are prompted about files that are missing or in use, click the check box next to**Do this for all current items** and click**Skip** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 9: Disable in-game overlay on Uplay and Steam

 This method works for many players as it will stop overlay conflicting if that’s the cause of Rainbow Six Siege lagging.

1) Open Uplay and click the gear icon in the top right corner.

2) Click Settings, then go to the**General** tab, and uncheck the box**Enable in-game overlay for supported games** .

3) Open Steam and navigate to**Settings** .

4) Go to the**In-Game** tab, and uncheck the box**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .

Try playing Rainbow Six Siege again to see if the lag is gone for now.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 10: Turn off game mode

 1) Type game mode in the Windows search bar and select Game Mode settings.

 2) Toggle**Game Mode** off.

 This works for many Rainbow Six Siege players, and you can also turn off everything related to Game DVR or game recording if this doesn’t do the trick.

---

 If all fails, you may need to reinstall the Rainbow Six Siege. This may be the last resort and most of the time, it works.
