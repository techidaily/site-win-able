### Fix 4 â€“ Update your graphics driver

 If you keep running into Biomutant crashing, itâ€™s likely that your graphics driver is faulty or outdated. To ensure a smooth gaming experience at all times, you should update the graphics driver to the latest.

There are two ways to do this:

**Manually** â€“ You can search for the most recent driver thatâ€™s corresponding with your operating system from the manufacturersâ€™ websites ([AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) ), and then download the driver manually.

**Automatically (Recommended)** â€“ If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver on your own, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy.](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  it takes just 2 clicks:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). Or you could click**Update** to do it for free, but itâ€™s partly manual.

 So does the driver update dramatically boost the game performance? If not, check out the next method below.

### Fix 5 â€“ Disable overlays

 According to other players, the Steam overlay is a buggy feature that can trigger Biomutant crashing. Simply disable this option to see how the game works. If youâ€™re using an overlay with any third-party app, make sure to turn them off as well.

1. Open Steam and navigate to the**Library** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-game-files-steam.jpg)
2. Right-click Biomutant on the list and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/verify-1.jpg)
3. On the **General** tab, untick **Enable Steam overlay while in-game** .
