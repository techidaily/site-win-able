### Fix 1: Download an invisible cursor theme file

 To solve the mouse cursor that appears on the black bars in-game issue, download an invisible cursor theme file would do the job.

 This might be the easiest way to do it, but you have to restore it back when you’re done playing.

1. [Download](http://www.jholjhaal.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/HiddenCursor.cur) the blank mouse cursor file.
2. Press the**Window logo key + I** together and click**Devices** .

### Fix 2: Change resolution

 Many players have found out the best resolution to solve this cursor issue is**16:9** . That means if you have 1680: 1050, select 1600 x 900 instead. If you run the game with a 16: 10 monitor, the black bar would appear on the bottom of your screen and the desktop mouse becomes visible. The game would be unplayable because of sensitivity and aiming issues.

1. Launch the game.
2. Go to**Options > Display** .
3. Choose**Screen Resolution** that fits your PC, remember the 16: 9 works better.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021-05-18_11-14-23.jpg)
4. Make sure you’re in full screen, not borderless window.

### Fix 3: Change mouse settings

 Change the in-game mouse settings might help. Players have proved that the max sensitivity is not 10 and you can set the number go beyond 10.

 Maxing your**Mouse Sensitivity** ,**Movement Camera Sensitivity with Mouse** and**DPI of mouse** in game.

If this fix brings no luck, move to the next one.

### Fix 4: Update device driver

 Keeping your drivers updated is important to your PC. If driver on your PC is outdated or corrupted, you may encounter crashes or other issues that won’t let you enjoy the game. To prevent potential risks, you need to update your device driver regularly.

There are two ways you can update your device drivers:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version. Or you can use Windows update, but Windows doesn’t give you the latest drivers.

 A**utomatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:
