##  Use Conditional Formatting to Color Every Other Row

 Maybe you don't want to format your data as a table. In this case, you can [use conditional formatting](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-depth-asmr-video-insights/) to apply alternating row colors.

 If you only want to apply the color to a certain cell range, select those cells. To color all alternating rows in the whole sheet, click the Select All (triangle) button on the top left of the sheet.

 Go to the Home tab, select the Conditional Formatting drop-down arrow in the Styles section, and choose "New Rule."

![Excel with alternate row colors](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ExcelAlternateRowColors.png) 

 At the top of the pop-up window below Select a Rule Type, pick "Use a Formula to Determine Which Cells to Format."

![Excel with alternate row colors](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ExcelAlternateRowColors.png) 

 In the bottom section below Edit the Rule Description, enter the following formula in the "Format Values Where This Formula is True" box:

=MOD(ROW(),2)=0

![Excel with alternate row colors](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ExcelAlternateRowColors.png) 

 Select "Format" and choose the color you want to use for the alternating rows on the Fill tab. You can also use a pattern with or without a color if you like. You'll see a preview of the color at the bottom. If you're happy with it, click "OK."

 If you want to apply a color to the odd rows as well, create another new conditional rule and use this formula:

=MOD(ROW(),2)=1

![Excel with alternate row colors](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ExcelAlternateRowColors.png) 

 Follow the same steps to choose the color and apply the rule.
