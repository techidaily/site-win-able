 New World, one of the most anticipated blockbusters, is finally out. But when gamers try to get lost in this brand new MMO, they find themselves facing**constant crashes at startup or in-game** . Sometimes it prompts a Fatal Error, but in most cases there wasn’t any warning at all.

 If you happen to be one of them, don’t worry. Here’re some working fixes that could bring back your game without frying your graphics card.

## Try these fixes

 You might not need to try them all. Simply work your way down until you find the one that does the charm.

1. **[Verify the integrity of game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. [**Update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Make sure your system is up to date**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

5. [**Increase your virtual memory**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. **[Delete specific game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Verify the integrity of game files

 AAA titles tend to be large, and they’re likely to crash when there’re missing or corrupted game files. To make sure the data is intact and up to date, you need to**verify the integrity of your game files** .

1. Open your Steam client and go to**LIBRARY** . Right click **New World** and select **Properties** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=39655089&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://incomedia.eu/files/images/affiliates/wa/01_WA_728x90.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/new-world-verify-3.jpg)
2. In the left pane, select **LOCAL FILES** . Then click **Verify integrity of game files** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/new-world-verify-4.jpg)
3. Allow the checking to complete. Then you can start New World and see if it crashes again.

If the problem persists, take a look at the next fix below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The constant crashes might indicate a driver issue. In other words, you might be using**a faulty or outdated graphics driver** . You should always keep your driver up to date for the best in-game performance. And this is especially the case when you are dealing with new titles like New World.

 Prior to the release date, both NVIDIA and AMD have published the**New World compatible GPU driver** . See below for update instructions.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), finding the latest correct installer and installing step-by-step. But if you don’t have the time or patience to install manually, you can do that automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/last-scan-never.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-pro-update-all-rtx-3090.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your drivers, restart your PC and test the gameplay in New World.

 If the latest graphics driver doesn’t give you luck, go ahead and try the next fix below.

### Fix 3: Make sure your system is up to date

 Besides drivers, it’s also important you keep Windows up to date. The latest system updates offer bug fixes and sometimes a performance boost, which might make a difference in fixing the crashing issue.

Here’s how you can check for updates manually:

1. On your keyboard, press **Win** (the Windows logo key). At the bottom left corner of your screen, click the**gear icon** to open Settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-gear-icon.jpg)
2. Scroll down and select**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update.jpg)
3. Click**Windows Update** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update-2.jpg)
4. Click**Check for updates** . Then wait for the process to complete. After that, restart your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/windows-10-start-menu-open-settings-update-3.jpg)

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** again.

 Once you’ve installed all the updates, restart your PC and check if New World crashes again.

If your system is already up to date, you can try the next method.

### Fix 4: Change in-game graphics settings

 Some players reported that turning off certain graphics settings might be the cure for the crash. You can try the same and see how things go:

1. Open New World. On the top right corner, click the**gear icon** to open settings.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/new-world-change-graphics-1.jpg)
2. In the left pane, select**Visuals** . Then set**Object details** to**High** or lower.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ukaidot.sjv.io/c/5597632/1793234/19578" target="_top" id="1793234"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19578-1793234" border="0" alt="" width="678" height="452"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1793234/19578" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/new-world-change-graphics-2.jpg)

Now you can play and check if the crash stops.

 If changing graphics settings doesn’t give you luck, continue to the next fix below.

### Fix 5: Increase your virtual memory

 New World recommend 16GB RAM so you better check if you meets this requirement. There’re already reports showing that the game might crash if your PC runs out of memory. If that’s your case, you can try to increase your virtual memory:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and type **advanced system settings** . Click **View advanced system settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/search-advanced-system-settings.jpg)
2. Under the **Performance**  section, click **Settings…** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/system-advanced-performance-virtual-memory.jpg)
3. In the pop-up window, navigate to the **Advanced**  tab. Under the **Virtual memory** section, click **Change…** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/virtual-memory-advanced.jpg)
4. Deselect the **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** checkbox. Then select **Customize size** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/vritual-memory-set.jpg)
5. Enter **Initial size** and **Maximum size** according to the physical memory of your computer. Microsoft recommends that virtual memory should be 1.5 to 3 times the size of physical memory. In my case, the physical memory (actual RAM) of my computer is 8 GB, so the **Initial size** for me here is **8 x 1024 x 1.5 = 12288 MB** , and the **Maximum size** should be **8 x 1024 x 3 = 24576 MB** . Once you’ve entered your size of virtual memory, click **Set** , then click **OK**  to save the changes.

6. Restart your computer and check if New World crashes again.

 If this trick doesn’t do the trick for you, take a look at the next solution.

### Fix 6: Delete specific game files

 According to some players, one possible fix to the crash is to delete certain game files. If you have tried all the fixes above and none seemed to work, you can try this method and test the result.

 You should always back up the files before deleting in case things go south.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**%appdata%** and click**OK** .

2. Go to**AGS > New World** and delete the following:  
   * The**savedata** folder  
   * The**user\_preload\_settings** file
3. Now you can restart New World and see if the game crashes again.
