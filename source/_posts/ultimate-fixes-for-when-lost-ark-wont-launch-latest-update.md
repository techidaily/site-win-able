### Fix 2 – Verify integrity of game files

 Missing or corrupted game file is a common reason that a game stops working smoothly. To see if that’s the case with Lost Ark, try to verify the integrity of the game files.

### Fix 3 – Update your graphics driver

 Game issues are usually driver-related. If you’re using a broken or outdated graphics driver, Lost Ark may not launch the right way. To gain the best in-game performance, you should update your graphics drivers regularly.

 Main graphics card manufacturers constantly roll out new drivers for the latest titles. You could visit their official websites ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)**  ), find the driver corresponding with your operating system, download and install it manually.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).  

 You can also get the drivers you need for free, but you’ll need to download them one at a time and manually install it.

### Fix 4 – Run Lost Ark as an administrator

 Due to the lack of administrative rights, a program or game may not access certain files and therefore fails to launch. To avoid permission issues like this, you should run Lost Ark as an administrator as follow.

1. Go to the Lost Ark installation folder, which you can find at_C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Lost Ark\\Binaries_ \\_Win64_ . If it’s not there, launch your Steam client, right-click the game, select**Properties** \>**Local Files** \>**Browse local files** .
2. Right-click the**LOSTARK.exe file** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/run-as-administrator-lost-ark-2.jpg)
3. Select the**Compatibility** tab. Tick**Disable full-screen optimizations** and**Run this program as an administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/run-as-administrator-lost-ark-1.jpg)
4. Click**OK** .

 Try launching the game to see how things go. Still no luck? Take a look at the next method.

### Fix 5 – Turn off unnecessary programs

 When you have too many programs running in the background, it can eat up the system resources (CPU and bandwidth), and therefore make your Lost Ark not launch or work. To solve this, just shut down all the unnecessary programs besides Steam and the game launcher.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Type**taskmgr** and press**Enter** .

### Fix 6 – Switch to DX9

 Some Lost Ark players experienced performance issues such as crashing or stuttering when running the game on DX11\. If you’re in the same situation, launching the game in DX9 may mitigate your problem.

1. Launch Steam and go to the**Library** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-game-files-steam.jpg)
2. Right-click**Lost Ark** from the game list and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/verify-1.jpg)
3. Under Launch Options, type**\-force-d3d9** and close the window.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/swtich-to-dx9.jpg)

 Now relaunch Steam and Lost Ark. Is it able to work correctly in the DX9 version? If not, try the next fix below.

### Fix 7 – Repair the system files
