### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The graphics card is no doubt one of the most important hardware for gaming. So **if your graphics driver is outdated or faulty, you might experience a black screen while playing Rainbow Six Siege** . Besides, the manufacturers of graphics cards frequently release new drivers, which usually can improve the performance of new games. If you donâ€™t remember the last time you updated your graphics driver, then now is a great time to have it done.

Here are two ways you can try to update your graphics driver:

#### Option 1 â€” Manually

 You can go to the official website ( **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  ) of your graphics card to download and install the latest version of the driver. This needs some time, patience and computer skills.

#### **Option 2 â€” Automatically (Recommended)**

 If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system, find the correct drivers for your exact devices and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
