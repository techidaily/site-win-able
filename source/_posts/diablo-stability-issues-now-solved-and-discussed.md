### Fix 1 – Verify the integrity of game files

 Before trying anything more complicated, you could check if the game files are missing or corrupted. That will prevent your FIFA 22 from running normally. Below is the detailed instruction for an integrity check on **[Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[Origin](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

#### If you’re on Steam

1. Launch your Steam client and select**Library** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/3-1-1.jpg)
2. Right-click**FIFA 22** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-16_16-16-14-3.jpg)
3. Select the**Local Files** tab and click**Verify integrity of game files** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-game-files.jpg)

 Once the process completes, restart your game to see how it works. If the crashes reoccur, read[Fix 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

#### If you’re on Origin

1. Open Origin and click**My Game Library** from the left pane. Then select FIFA 22 from the list.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/origin-verify-game-files.jpg)
2. Click the**gear icon** under the Play button and click**Repair** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/origin-verify-game-files-2.jpg)

 It may take a few minutes to scan and repair, and then you can test if the crashing issue is still there. If yes, try the second solution.

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 The constant FIFA 22 crashes can also indicate a driver issue. If you’re using a broken or outdated graphics driver, various gaming problems can occur and affect your experience. To avoid any annoying crashing issues, make sure to keep your graphics driver up-to-date.

Here are two ways you can update the graphics driver easily and quickly:

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Graphics card manufacturers keep updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to their websites ([AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) ), find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version and download it manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update the graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-1.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to a flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update** **All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-2.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Now all your device drivers are the latest. Check if FIFA 22 is back to the normal state. If not, there are three more fixes to try.

### Fix 3 – Change the DirectX settings

 If you’re running into FIFA 22 crashing with a specific DirectX error, a possible method is to change the DirectX settings. Take the steps below to see if that helps your case.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Window logo key** and**E** at the same time to open the File Explorer, and navigate to**Document** .
2. Open the FIFA 22 folder. Then right-click the**fifasetup.ini file** and click**Open with** \>**Notepad** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/chaneg-directx-setting.jpg)
3. If you see**DIRECTX\_SELECT = 0** , change the value to**1** . If it’s 1, change it to 0.
4. Pree**Ctrl** and**S** on your keyboard to save the changes.

 Test if FIFA 22 runs smoothly after the tweaks. If your game is still unplayable, move on to the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4 – Disable overlay

 In some cases, the overlay of the game launcher like Steam or Origin may cause FIFA 22 to crash or function improperly. It is an interface that allows you to access voice chat or other features. If that’s not necessary for you, just turn it off.

#### On Steam

1. Open Steam and select the**Library** tab.

2. From the game list, right-click**FIFA** **22** and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-16_16-16-14-3.jpg)
3. Untick**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/disable-steam-overaly.jpg)

 Play the game again to see if this method does the trick. If not, follow[Fix 5](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to adjust the in-game settings.

#### On Origin

1. Launch Origin. Select**My Game Library** , and choose the FIFA 22 tile.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/origin-verify-game-files.jpg)
2. Click the**gear icon** and click**Game Properties** .

<a href="https://store.movavi.com/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=MOVAVI&AFFILIATE=108875&PATH=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.movavi.com%3FAFFILIATE%3D108875%26RESOURCE%3DMovavi%2BVideo%2BEditor%2Bbox"><img src="https://mcusercontent.com/0885a03ded3d480dca9287f12/images/6d3207fd-9f15-4c21-f0ad-59c68e6a7e2a.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/disable-origin-in-game.jpg)
3. Make sure**Enable Origin In Game for FIFA 22 Ultimate Edition** is**unticked** . Click**Save** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/disable-origin-in-game-2.jpg)

 How does the game work with overlay disabled? If it keeps crashing as before, continue to the next fix.

### Fix 5 – Optimize the graphics settings

 Running FIFA 22 on high or ultra graphics may deliver a better experience. But if your machine isn’t powerful enough, the game may become unstable and you’d better lower certain settings.

1. Launch FIFA 22 and select**Game** **Settings** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=45152835&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://download.terabyteunlimited.com/banners/ad_800x450_d.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/game-settings.jpg)
2. Select the**Windowed** or**Windowed** **Borderless** mode.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/game-settings-2.jpg)
3. Select**Lock to 60fps** under Frame Rates, and click**OK** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://boody-eco-wear.pxf.io/c/5597632/1567905/13846" target="_top" id="1567905"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/13846-1567905" border="0" alt="" width="300" height="250"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1567905/13846" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/game-settings-3.jpg)

 Open the game to check out on its performance. Still no luck? Try the last method.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6 – Reinstall the game

 If none of the fixes above resolves your FIFA 22 crashing issue, try reinstalling the game from scratch. After uninstalling FIFA 22, also remember to**delete the remaining game files** . And if possible,**install the game on SSD** , which, according to some players, solved the crashing dramatically.
