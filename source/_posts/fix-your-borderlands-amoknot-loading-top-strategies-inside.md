### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Graphics card manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD and Intel constantly release new graphics drivers to fix bugs and improve the gaming performance and experience.

 If the graphics driver on your PC is outdated or corrupted, you may not be able to enjoy the optimal gaming experience, and sometimes you may run into the Borderlands 3 crash issue.

 To fix this issue, the first thing you should do is update your graphics driver. There are two ways that you can update your graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics cards, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Check-for-updates.png)

**Visual C++ Redistributable 2013:**
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784)
  
**Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5:**
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653)

 After installing Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 and Microsoft .NET Framework, you need to restart Windows. Then launch Borderlands 3 to see if this issue persists. If not, congratulations, you’ve resolved this issue! If this issue reappears, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 4: Modify the graphics settings in the game

 If your PC fails to meet the recommended system requirements for Borderlands 3, you should use a reduced settings profile for graphics related features, because higher settings will increase the workload for your PC, which may even lead to game crash issue.

 According to the players who successfully fixed this issue, here’re some tips you can try:

* **Use Fullscreen instead of Windowed Borderless**
* **Turn off VSync**
* **Set your frame cap to whatever your monitor refresh rate is set to**

 Launch the game again in a reduced settings to see it it crashes or not. If the game still crashes, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 5: Stop overclocking

 Many players would like to overclock the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card to gain a better FPS. However, overclocking usually crashes the game. To prevent game crashes, you should reset the CPU or the graphics card to the manufacturer specifications.

 Some players reported that the game may crash when they’re using MSI Afterburner or Zotac Firestorm. So if you’ve enabled MSI Afterburner or Zotac Firestorm, try disabling them to see if this issue persists. If not, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 6: Verify the game file

 The game crash issue can also be triggered by the faulty game files. To fix this issue, you need to verify the game files. Here is how to do it:

1. In Epic Game Launcher, navigate to your **Library** . Click **the cog icon** on the lower-right corner of **Borderlands 3** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-26_11-12-38.png)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-19_18-50-45.png)

### Fix 7: Add Borderland 3 as an exception to your 3rd party antivirus software

 This issue may also be caused by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with Borderlands 3.

 Since Borderlands 3 consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, many third-party antivirus application may regard it as a potential threat and Borderlands 3 may not run as expected. You can try   **adding Borderlands 3 as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.
