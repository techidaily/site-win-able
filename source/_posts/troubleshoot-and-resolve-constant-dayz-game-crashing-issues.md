### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of this problem is an outdated or a faulty**graphics** driver. There are two ways you can get the right drivers for your graphics card: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 A**utomatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics cards, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/DE-scan-screen.png)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. You need the Pro version of Driver Easy to do this, so you’ll be prompted to upgrade.

### Fix 5: Perform a Windows Update

 According to the game developers, if MS Visual C++ is missing or corrupted, you may also run into the Dying Light crash issue. To resolve this problem, you need to reinstall Official Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 and .NET Framework.

 If your PC is running on Windows 10, you can perform a Windows Update to update and install the latest version of Visual C++ and .NET Framework. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open**Windows Settings** . Then click**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/update1.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will start searching for available updates. If there are updates available, Windows will automatically download and install the updates.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Check-for-updates.png)

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4721564&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/c14a8df1e1b4d5297e9cb30cb34d5a00/products/copy_power-tools-48.png" border="0">Power Tools add-on for Google Sheets, 12-month subscription</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 If there are no updates related to MS Visual C++ or .NET Framework, you can download their installation files via the links below on your own and manually install them on your PC.

**Microsoft Visual C++ 2013** :  
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784)
**Microsoft .NET Framework** :  
[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653)

 After installing Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 and Microsoft .NET Framework, you need to restart Windows. Then launch Dying Light to see if this issue persists. If not, congratulations, you’ve resolved this issue! If this issue reappears, try the next fix, below.

---

### Fix 6: Stop overclocking

 Many players would like to overclock the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card to gain a better FPS. However, overclocking usually crashes the game. To prevent game crashes, you should reset the CPU or the graphics card to the manufacturer specifications.

 Some players reported that the game may crash when they’re using MSI Afterburner. So if you’ve enabled MSI Afterburner, try disabling it to see if this issue persists. If not, try the next fix, below.

---

### Fix 7: Turn off Game Mode in Windows 10

 The Game Mode in Windows 10 may also crash Dying Light. Some players reported in the Steam community that after they turned off Game Mode, they can play Dying Light without crashes. You can follow the steps below to turn off Game Mode in Windows 10:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and type**game mode** , then**select Game Mode settings** from the list of search results.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/windows-game-mode.png)
2. **Turn off the toggle** under**Game Mode** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Game-Mode-Windows-10.png)

 Launch Dying Light again after you disabled Game Mode to see if this fix works. If not, try the next fix, below.

---

### Fix 8: Reinstall the game and run Windows compatibility troubleshooter

 If none of the fixes above works for you, you may need to try reinstalling the game to see if it would crash again. Normally, Dying Light won’t crash after you reinstall it.

 Before reinstalling the game, you should totally uninstall it from your PC. Please make sure you have deleted any files related to Dying Light, such as C:\\Users\\USER\_NAME\\My Documents\\DyingLight.

 After reinstalling it, run the game to see if you can play it without crashes.

 If the game crashing issue persists, maybe it is a compatibility issue. According to the game developers, Windows 10 is not officially supported by Dying Light, as the game had been created earlier and supports 64-bit Windows 7/8/8.1\. So you can try running Dying Light in Windows 7 compatibility mode. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your desktop,**right-click** on the shortcut of Dying Light, then select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-12_12-24-18.png)
2. In the Properties Window, navigate to**the Compatibility tab** ,**check the box** next to**Run this program in compatibility mode for:** and select**Windows 7** from the drop-down list.**Check the box** next to**Run as an administrator** and click**OK** to save the changes.

</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019-09-12_14-25-41.png)
3. Double-click the shortcut of Dying Light on your desktop to launch it. This time Dying Light will run in the compatibility mode you set in step 2.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 See if this fix works for you. If this issue never reappears in the compatibility mode, it suggests that the cause of the issue is the game incompatibility in Windows 10.
