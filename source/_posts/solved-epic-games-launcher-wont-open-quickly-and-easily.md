Below are the minimum and recommended system requirements for DayZ:

#### The minimum system requirements for DayZ

| **OS:**         | Windows 7/8.1 64-bit                  |

| **Sound Card:** | DirectX®-compatible                   |
| **Network:**    | Internet connection                   |

#### The recommended system requirements for DayZ

| **Sound Card:** | DirectX®-compatible                   |
| **Network:**    | Internet connection                   |

 If your PC fails to meet DayZ minimum system requirements, you may not be able to run the game properly on your PC. In such a case, you need to **upgrade your hardware first** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Add DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be triggered by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with DayZ.

 Since DayZ consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, many third-party antivirus application may regard it as a potential threat. You can try   **adding DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.
