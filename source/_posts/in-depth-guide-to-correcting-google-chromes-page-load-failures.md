### Fix 2: Update your network adapter driver

 If the game is stuck in 0 and never gets up while downloading, there might be some issue with your wireless adapter driver. A missing or corrupted driver may be the root of this issue.   **Try updating the driver for your wireless network adapter**  to see if you can resolve it.

 There are two ways to update the driver for your wireless network adapter: **manually** and **automatically** .

**Manually update the driver for your wireless network adapter** – You can update it manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your wireless network adapter.

 **Update the driver for your wireless network adapter automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your network driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your device, and it will download and install them correctly:

 3) Click **Update** next to your wireless network adapter to automatically download the correct version of its driver, then you can install it manually. Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All.**  You get **full support** and a **30-day money back** guarantee).

### Fix 3: Disable antivirus software

 Though the download appears to be complete, your antivirus or firewall program may block game files during the installation process for safety purposes. Disabling your antivirus program would address the issue.  
 The most common offenders are AVG and Avast antivirus, we encourage you to try this solution when you encounter this issue.

1) Disable your antivirus software.

2) Uninstall the game.

3) Restart your PC.

4) Reinstall the game.

 If it’s not working, you can move to the next fix. Remember to enable your antivirus to protect your PC.  

### Fix 4: Update your Windows system

 If you haven’t updated your Windows system to the latest version, you can give it a try. Some gamers have proved that installing updates for the Windows system is a working fix.

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **I** at the same time to open the **Windows Settings** . Then select **Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/updates-security.jpg)

 2) Under Windows Update, click **Check for updates** . Then Windows will automatically download and install the available updates.  
![Windows update check for updates](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Windows-update-check-for-updates.png)

 3) Once you’ve installed all the updates, restart your computer and try to launch the game.

If the problem remains, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 5: Reset or reinstall Windows

 If you’re still facing problems while downloading or installing, you can perform a Windows reset or maybe even reinstall it together. We all know reinstalling will delete all the data on your hard drive, you should back up all your important files before doing it.

 But with **[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , there’s **no need for lengthy back-ups, support phone calls, or risk to your personal data** . It can reset Windows to the state exactly when it was just installed without affecting third-party software.  
 Here’s how to use it:

 But treat these options as a last resort, because they both take quite a long time.
