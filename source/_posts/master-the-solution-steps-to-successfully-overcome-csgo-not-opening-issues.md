### Fix 3: Fix SteamVR installation path

 When Steam was installed in a non-default folder and your SteamVR configuration path may be related to a non-existent path. This will cause you meet the SteamVR error 308\. You can fix it by correcting the installation path.

1. Close Steam and SteamVR completely.
2. Navigate to “…/username/AppData/Local/openvr” and delete the “openvr.vrpath”.  
**OR**  
 Navigate to “…Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/win64” and run**vrpathtreg** to fix the path.
3. Reboot Steam and SteamVR.

### Fix 4: Update your driver

 The missing or outdated device drivers in your computer can result in issues. To rule it out as the cause for your problem, you should verify that your drivers are up to date, and update those that aren’t.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download drivers from the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have time or patience to manually update your drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
