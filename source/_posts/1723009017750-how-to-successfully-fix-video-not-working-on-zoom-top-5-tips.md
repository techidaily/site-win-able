### Fix 1 – Allow Zoom to access your camera

 A common cause that your camera isn’t working on an app is related to the permission settings. If you don’t allow the camera access for Zoom, it would stuck at a failed video. To enable the permission properly, follow the steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open the Settings menu.
2. Select**Privacy** .

3. Click **Camera** on the left pane. Then, click the **Change** button and turn on the Camera access for this device.

4. **Toggle on** the button under Allow apps to access your camera.

 Once applying the changes, you can relaunch Zoom and see if the camera is able to work correctly. If not, check out the next fix below.

### Fix 2 – Close other programs that use the camera

 When other programs are utilizing your camera, Zoom may lose control of your camera and therefore cannot start a video. To make sure there’s no interference with your webcam, try closing unncessary programs especially those telecommunication apps like Skype, WhatsApp, Discord or Microsoft Teams.

1. Right-click the empty space on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

2. Right-click the application you want to shut down and click**End task** .

### Fix 3 – Adjust the Zoom settings

 If you’ve constantly disconnected and reconnected your camera, the Zoom’s settings may be messed up. To ensure your camera is correctly selected, you should check the app settings. Here is how.

3. Select the**Video** tab. Then choose the correct camera from the drop-down menu.

 Check if the Zoom video issue is solved now. If not, there are two more fixes to try.

### Fix 4 – Update your camera driver

 If the camera driver on your PC is faulty or outdated, you may encounter the Zoom cannot start video issue. To keep your camera working at the best performance, you should update its driver to the latest.

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can update the driver manually. Just visit the website of your camera manufacturer, download the latest driver that’s right for your operating system, and install them manually.

 But if you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
