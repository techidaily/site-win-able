1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open the Settings menu.
2. Select**Privacy** .

### Fix 2 – Close other programs that use the camera

 When other programs are utilizing your camera, Zoom may lose control of your camera and therefore cannot start a video. To make sure there’s no interference with your webcam, try closing unncessary programs especially those telecommunication apps like Skype, WhatsApp, Discord or Microsoft Teams.

1. Right-click the empty space on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1-10.jpg)
2. Right-click the application you want to shut down and click**End task** .

 Restart Zoom and test. If the error reoccurs, continue to the next solution.

### Fix 4 – Update your camera driver

 If the camera driver on your PC is faulty or outdated, you may encounter the Zoom cannot start video issue. To keep your camera working at the best performance, you should update its driver to the latest.

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can update the driver manually. Just visit the website of your camera manufacturer, download the latest driver that’s right for your operating system, and install them manually.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged webcam driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version** ).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you‘ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and R to invoke the Run box. Type in**appwiz.cpl** in the field and click**OK** .
