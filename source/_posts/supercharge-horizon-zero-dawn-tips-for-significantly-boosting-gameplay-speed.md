6. **[Adjust the NVIDIA settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 – Update your graphics driver

 A broken or outdated graphics driver can trigger a variety of gaming issues such as constant stuttering or massive FPS drops. If you’re playing AAA titles like Elden Ring with high system requirements, you should definitely update your graphics driver to gain the best in-game experience.

To keep your graphics driver up-to-date, here are two options for you:

**Option 1 – Manually** : Major GPU manufacturers release new drivers regularly. You can go to their websites such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)**  , find the latest driver corresponding with your operating system, and download it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically** : If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** .)

 After the driver update, relaunch the game to see how it works. If the problem persists, there are more fixes to try.

### Fix 2 – Optimize graphics settings

 If you’re using a laptop or multi-GPU system, make sure the dedicated GPU is properly utilized. If not, you’ll see huge FPS drops and it’s better to tweak the settings for maximum performance

1. In the Windows search box, type**graphics settings** and select**Graphics settings** from the result.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/graphics-settings-1.jpg)
2. Click**Desktop app** from the drop-down list and click**Browse** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/dedicated-gpu-3.jpg)
3. Go to the game’s installation folder and add the**eldenring.exe file** .

If this method doesn’t work, try the next solution.

### Fix 3 – Verify integrity of game files

 Missing or corrupted game files could also lead to annoying issues like Elden Ring FPS drops. Before moving on to the more advanced steps, you could check if there’s something wrong with your game files and repair it automatically in Steam. Here are the steps:

1. Launch your Steam client and select the**Library** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-game-files-steam.jpg)
2. Right-click**Elden Ring** from the game list and click**Properties** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://ancheer.sjv.io/c/5597632/1657301/17326" target="_top" id="1657301"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17326-1657301" border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="933"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1657301/17326" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-1-1.jpg)
3. Select**LOCAL FILES** and click**Verify integrity of game files** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/steam-verify-game-files-1.jpg)

 It may take a while for Steam to scan and repair the game files, which will replace the wrong files with those from the official server. Now check if you get smoother gameplay. If not, try the next fix below.

### Fix 4 – Disable Steam overlay

 The in-game overlay is another common cause of FPS-related issues. You could simply turn it off and see if this helps improve the performance.

1. Open Steam and click**Library** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-game-files-steam.jpg)
2. From the game list, right-click Elden Ring and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/verify-1-1.jpg)
3. Untick**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/steam-overlay.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 5 – Disable Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator

 Some players also reported that disabling Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator resolves the stuttering dramatically. Disabling this device may stop some part of the device driver from installing, but your computer will work normally for the most part.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run command. Type**devmgmt.msc** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-1-1.jpg)
2. Double-click**Software devices** to open the category.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/device-manager-1.jpg)
3. Right-click**Microsoft Device Association Root Enumerator** and click**Disable device** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/device-manager-2.jpg)
4. Click**Yes** to confirm.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/device-manager-3.jpg)

 Test if you has an instant FPS boost. If so, you can enable the device again while you’re not playing the game. If the issue reoccurs, turn the device on and then take a look at the last fix.

### Fix 6 – Adjust the NVIDIA settings

 If all the methods above don’t help and you’re using an NVIDIA graphics card, adjusting specific graphical settings may increase your FPS in Elden Ring.

1. Right-click any empty space on your desktop and click**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-3-1.jpg)
2. Click **3D settings** \> **Manage 3D settings** in the left pane.
