> Dear How-To Geek,
> 
> Is it possible to select the shortcut picture for a file? I have 3 Excel files which have shortcuts on my desktop, Budget 2010, Budget 2011 and Budget 2012\. This gets confusing as both the name of the files and the shortcut picture is the same. I don't want to change the name of the files, I want to change the picture.

 Dear Multiple Files,

 Absolutely, you can just go into the shortcut properties by right-clicking on it. Then find the Change Icon button, and select a different icon. You can even download icons, save them somewhere, and then use those for the shortcut.

 We've done the same thing for some highly used but similarly named documents.

 Dear Missing Icons,

 Sometimes the system icons vanish in response to other variables on the computer. It's easy enough to get them back. Right click on your taskbar and click Properties. Then click the Taskbar tab in the menu that pops up. Halfway down the Taskbar options menu there is a Customize button in the Notification section. Click on that to toggle Notification Area icons on and off, including your missing volume icon.

 Dear Phone-Irritated,

 You didn't specify which smartphone you're using... but that's OK! We have a handy tutorial that covers sharing link between popular web browsers and popular phone operating systems including iOS, Android, BlackBerry and more, right [here](https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/new-deciding-on-a-stage-obs-versus-twitch-for-2024/). Hit up that link and you'll be able to easily shuttle links from your browser to your smartphone; no pecking on a tiny touchscreen necessary.
