 Make sure your computer meets the minimum requirements to run_DBD_ , then read on and check the fix, below.

#### Fix 2: Restart your computer

 Some programs running on your computer may conflict with _Dead by Daylight_ or Steam, resulting in crashing issues. In this case, you can try a simple reboot to end unwanted programs completely.

 After your computer restarts, relaunch_DBD_ to see if your issue has been fixed. If not, move on to the next fix, below.

#### Fix 3: Run your game as an Administrator

 Under normal user mode,_Dead by Daylight_  or Steam sometimes may fail to access certain game files on your PC, which could be the reason why the game keeps crashing.

 To see if that’s the problem for you, try running Steam as an administrator, then launch your game from Steam. Here is how to do it:

1. Right-click your **Steam** icon and select **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-56.png)
2. Select the **Compatibility**  tab. Tick the box for **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **Apply > OK**  to save the changes.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-57.png)
3. Relaunch Steam and _DBD_ to test your issue.

 You can hopefully run the game without crashing now. If your problem still exists, then move on to the fix below.

#### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of_Dead by Daylight_ (and other games) crashing issues is an outdated or faulty graphics driver. It’s essential that you have the latest correct graphics driver at all times. There are two ways you can update your graphics driver:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fixed-dead-by-daylight-keeps-crashing-2019-tips/#g2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

##### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 The manufacturer of your graphics product keeps updating drivers. To get the latest graphics driver, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

##### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics drivers

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making mistakes when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy.

1. [Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
