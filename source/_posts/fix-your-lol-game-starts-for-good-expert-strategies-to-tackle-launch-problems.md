### Fix 2: Update your drivers

 This issue may also be caused by the outdated or missing drivers on your PC. If there is something wrong with your network driver or graphics driver, this issue may occur. In this case, you can try updating the drivers on your PC to the latest version to see if you can resolve this issue.

 There are two ways to update your drivers: **manually** and **automatically** .

**Update your drivers manually** – You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for your devices. Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your computer model and your version of Windows.

**?Or**

**Update your drivers automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your sound card driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all** .

 1\. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2\. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-581.png)

 3\. Click **Update** next to your device to automatically download the correct version of its driver, then you can install it manually. Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All.**  You get **full support** and a **30-day money back** guarantee).

### Fix 4: Unlink your Apex Legends account from your Steam account

 If you linked your Apex Legends account to your Steam account, you may also run into this issue. To fix it, you need to unlink it from your Steam account. Here is how to do it:

 1\. Visit[https://store.steampowered.com/join/](https://store.steampowered.com/join/) to create a new Steam account.

 2.**Exit and fully close** Apex Legends.

 3\. Open the browsing history in your browser, then search_<https://accounts.respawn.com/steam\_login.php?securityToken>_ to locate the URL of the page you used when linking your EA and Steam account. Click that URL to open it. Normally, you should see a page like the following:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-584-1024x754.png)

 4\. Click**Sign in through Steam** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-587-1024x754.png)

 5\. On the Steam page, log into**the new steam account you created in step One** .  
 You should see a window telling you that your account is now linked when you successfully logged into the new account.

 In order to link Apex Legends to your primary Steam account, you should save this URL address for the later use.

 6\. Launch Apex Legends to see if you fixed this issue. If not, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 5: Repair Apex Legends in Origin

 Corrupted game files can also be the cause of this issue. In this case, you can try repairing Apex Legends in Origin to see if you can fix it. Here is how to do it:

 1\. Open**Origin** .

 2\. Go to**My Game Library** , then**right-click** **Apex Legends** and select**Repair** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-591-1024x582.png)

3\. Wait until the verifying process completes.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-343-1024x728.png)

 4\. Launch Apex Legends when the verifying progress completes to see if this issue is resolved. If this issue reappears, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 6: Play with VPN

 Some players reported that when they play Apex Legends with VPN, this issue disappears. So before Respawn Entertainment releases game patches to fix this issue, playing with VPN temporarily may also be a good choice if you really want to play the game.

 The easiest way to set up a VPN connection on your PC is to download a VPN application.

 There’re some free VPN applications, but it’s not recommended to use those free VPN applications. If you use a free VPN, that VPN service provider has more reason to try and make money out of you.

 Here we recommend you **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . It helps you set up a fast, stable and secure Internet connection to anywhere. And it helps you do this with just a few clicks or taps! What’s more, with one NordVPN account, you can set up a VPN connection on all devices. NordVPN allows you to connect up to 6 devices at the same time!

#### To Set up a VPN connection on your Windows PC

 1\. Click **[here](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to visit the official website of NordVPN. Then follow the steps on its web page to**select your plan** and**create your NordVPN account** .

 2\. On your Windows PC, visit **[the NordVPN download page](https://nordvpn.com/download/windows/)**  to download and install it.

 3\. Launch NordVPN. Enter your NordVPN account and password, then click**Sign In** .

 4\. Click**Quick connect** to automatically connect to the server recommended for you. If you want to connect to another VPN server in a specific country, just select the server you want to connect to on the left panel, or click on the country pin on the map.

 1\. Open **Origin** .

 2\. Go to **My Game Library** , then **right-click** on **Apex Legends** and select **Uninstall** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/image-346-1024x728.png)
