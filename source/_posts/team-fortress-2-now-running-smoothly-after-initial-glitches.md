## Fix 2: Update graphics driver

 The broken or outdated graphics driver may also be the main culprit behind the game crashing issues.

 As we all know, an outdated or corrupted graphics driver would trigger game crashing, stuttering (FPS dropping) and even screen flickering issues. We always recommend gamers to keep their graphics drivers up to date so as to avoid such issues. The latest graphics driver will enhance your graphics card performance and unlock the full potential of your graphics card, which will give you an edge in PC video games.

 If you don’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it now.

There’re mainly two ways you can update your graphics drivers:

### Option 1: Manually

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

 Graphics card manufacturers like Nvidia, AMD and Intel keeps updating their graphics drivers. To get them , you need to go to the website of your graphics card manufacturer:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

 Then find the graphics driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Option 2: Automatically (Recommended)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Update graphics drivers with Driver Easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 You need to restart your PC after you finished updating your graphics driver.

 Launch A Total War Saga: Troy to see if it crashes or not. Normally, after you updated the graphics driver, the game crashing issue will disappear.

 If the latest graphics driver fails to stop the crash, just read on to try the next fix, below.

## Fix 3: Install the latest game patch

 The game developers release regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by Epic Games launcher, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Launch A Total War Saga: Troy to check whether the game crash issue has been resolved. If it hasn’t, or there was no new game patch available, move on to next fix, below.

## Fix 4: Install the latest DirectX files

 Most games require DirectX 11 to run properly, and A Total War Saga: Troy is no exception. If there’s a problem with DirectX, the game would crash on startup. If it’s the case, updating the DirectX to the latest version may help. Here is how to do it:

1. Go to[the Microsoft DirectX End-User Runtime Web Install page](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35) .
2. Click the Download button to start the download.  
![download latest DirectX](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/download-latest-DirectX.jpg)
3. Once downloaded, double-click the downloaded**.exe** file to install it on your computer.

## Fix 5: Stop overclocking

## Fix 7: Add A Total War Saga: Troy to the exceptions list of your 3rd party antivirus software

 If you have 3rd party antivirus software installed on your computer, make sure it doesn’t block the game files.
