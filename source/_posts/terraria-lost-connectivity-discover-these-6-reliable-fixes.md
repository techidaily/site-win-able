### Fix 1\. Check for the latest version of the game

 This connection issue happens most with multiplayer. If you get this error when you join a friend, you can log out and update Terraria. Also, ensure your friends are using the latest version of Terraria.

1. Go to your Steam**Library** .
2. Right-click**Terraria** and click**Properties** .

![verify integrity of game files](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/INTEGRITY-1.png)

 That will scan your game directory and compare it to the most updated version to find file differences and download files it’s missing.

### Fix 2\. Check if you’re playing different styles

 This error**Terraria Lost Connection** will occur if you don’t have a character to coordinate with the type of map.

 If you have a Classic Map or try to join someone’s Classic Mode game, you should have a Classic Character. Likewise, if you have a Journey Map / want to join a Journey Mode game, you should have a Journey Character.

 Make sure to create a character accordingly before and you won’t be seeing the**Connection Lost** error in Terraria.
