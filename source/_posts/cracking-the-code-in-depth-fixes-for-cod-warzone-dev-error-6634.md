## Fix 1: Check your Internet connection (Xbox & PC)

 A quick fix you can try for both Xbox and PC is to check your Internet connection. Low latency issues seem to have caused the Memory Error 0-1766 for some players, so you should check your Internet connection first as well. Here’s a few things you can do:

* It’s usually recommended to**use a wired connection for gaming** , since it’s more reliable and faster.
* But if you encounter the error with a wired connection, you can**switch to Wi-Fi** to test the issue.
* If you’re playing on Wi-Fi but still get the error, you can try to**power cycle your router and modem** . Unplug the cables from both of the devices, leave them disconnected for at least 30 seconds, then re-plug the cables back.
* You can also **disconnect the devices you don’t use at the moment from your Wi-Fi** to avoid overcrowding.

 If your Internet connection is solid but you still get the Memory Error 0-1766 on Warzone, try the next fix.

## Fix 2: Close running games and apps (Xbox & PC)

 If a few games and apps running in the background, your Xbox or PC won’t be able to let Warzone use all the resources and run smoother. Also background programs could interfere with Warzone, causing the Memory Error 0-1766\. Below is how to close the games and apps running in the background:

### On Xbox

1. Press the**Xbox button** on your controller to bring forward the menu sidebar.
2. You’ll see a list of games and apps. If a game or app is running, it’ll be highlighted. Select the games and apps you wish to close, then**press the Menu button** (the three-line button.)
3. Select**Quit** .

### On PC

1. Right-click your taskbar, then click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-25_15-29-08.jpg)
2. Under the**Processes** tab, you’ll see all the programs/processes that are running in the background. You can look for the processes that are CPU, memory and/or network-hogging, which is most likely to conflict with Warzone.  
 Take Chrome here, for example, right-click it then click**End task** .

## Fix 3: Adjust display settings (Xbox)

 Adjusting display settings has solved the Memory Error 0-1766 for many Warzone players on Xbox. Part of this fix is also the temporary workaround that Activision suggested at the moment, while they’re still working on an official fix.

 There are a few things you can do:**turn off 4K** ,**disable HDR** , and**set the resolution to 1080P** . Below is how:

1. Press the**Xbox button** .
2. Move right to select the**gear-shaped icon** and open**Settings** .
3. On the left panel, move down to**Display & Sound** , and select**Video output** .
4. Under the**Display** section, you can**adjust your Resolution to 1080P** .
5. Under the**Advanced** section, select**Video modes** .
6. Uncheck**Allow 4K and Allow HDR** .

 If you still get the Memory Error 0-1766 after adjusting the display settings on your Xbox console, try the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 4: Clear Mac address (Xbox)

 Clearing your Mac address gives a fresh reboot on your Xbox, and it’s likely to resolve the Memory Error 0-1766 on Warzone. The steps are quite easy, below is how:

1. Press the**Xbox button** .
2. Move right to select the**gear-shaped icon** and open**Settings** .
3. Scroll down to find**Network Settings** , and select**Advanced Settings** \>>**Alternate Mac Address** .
4. **Clear the Alternate Mac Address** . Your Xbox console should restart.

## Fix 5: Verify and repair your game files (PC)

 If you’re getting the COD Warzone Memory Error 0-1766 on PC, a quick fix you can try is to verify your game files. Damaged game files could cause the error, but you can do a quick scan and repair within the Battle.net app. Here’s how:

1. Launch the Battle.net client and go to the Warzone page.
2. Click the**gear-shaped icon** , then click**Scan and Repair** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-22_10-38-31-1.jpg)
3. Wait for the scan to complete, then re-launch Warzone to test if the error is resolved.

 If you’ve been accessing Warzone from Modern Warfare, you’ll need to go to the Modern Warfare page and do as Step 2 above instructs.

 If verifying and repairing your game files doesn’t solve your problem, try the last fix.

## Fix 6: Perform a clean boot (PC)

 Memory Error 0-1766 could be caused by services and startup items running in the background. If you’ve tried the fixes above but nothing worked, you can try to perform a clean boot.

 A clean boot will start your PC with the minimum sets of drivers and services that Windows requires to run. By doing a clean boot, you can identify if any services and startup items running in the background are interfering with Warzone.

**Here’s how to perform a clean boot:**

1. In the search bar next to the Start button, type**msconfig** then click**System Configuration** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-38-17.jpg)
2. Under the**Services** tab, check**Hide all Microsoft services** , then click**Disable all** and**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-40-15.jpg)
3. Move to the**Startup** tab, and click**Open Task Manager** .  
 (Windows 7 users: right-click an empty area on your taskbar to find the option of task manager.)

5. Restart your PC.

 If the Memory Error 0-1766 is now gone, this means at least one of the programs you disabled was causing the problem.  
  
**Here’s how to find out which one(s):**

1. In the search bar next to the Start button, type**msconfig** then click**System Configuration** .  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://parisrhonecom.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896607/21553" target="_top" id="1896607"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21553-1896607" border="0" alt="" width="750" height="422"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1896607/21553" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-38-17.jpg)
2. Under the**Services** tab, tick the**Hide all Microsoft services** checkbox**,** then tick the checkboxes in front of**the first five items** in the list.  
 Then click**Apply** and**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-28_16-53-16.jpg)
3. Reboot your computer and launch Warzone. If you get the Memory Error 0-1176 once again, then you know that one of the services you ticked above is conflicting with it. If the error is gone, then the above five services are fine, and you’ll have to keep looking for the offending service.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 above until you find the service that conflicts with Warzone.  

 NOTE: We recommend testing five items in a group since it’s more efficient, but you’re welcome to do it at your own pace.

 If you don’t find any problematic services, you’ll need to test the startup items.**Here’s how:**

1. Right-click anywhere empty on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .

3. Reboot and try launching Warzone to test if the error is resolved.
4. Repeat until you find the startup item that’s conflicting with Warzone and causing Memory Error 0-1766.
5. Disable the problem program and reboot your PC.

## Bonus Tip: Update the graphics driver on your PC

 If you run into other game errors or experiencing game crashes when your play Warzone on PC, you may need to update your graphics driver. A faulty or outdated graphics driver could cause a lot of problems and lead to game errors, so you need to make sure yours is up-to-date and functioning properly.
