### Fix 3: Update your audio driver

 Hardware problems can be caused by outdated or malfunctioning drivers. If the driver is outdated or wrong, it could cause problems like no sound and audio issues. So make sure your audio driver is up to date.

 You can update drivers manually by visiting the manufacturers’ official page and finding the most recent driver, then download and install it by yourself. Please note, you need to choose the one that suits your PC.

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your audio driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-pro-update-audio-bluetooth-usb-unifying.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

Then, reboot your PC and relaunch the game to check.

### Fix 4: Run as Administrator

 It’s a quick and easy fix that is worth trying. Run Lost Ark as Administrator so that the system won’t block its settings.

1. On your desktop, right-click on Lost Ark and click**Properties** .
2. Select the**Compatibility** tab.
3. Check**Run This Program As An Administrator** and**Disable full-screen optimisations** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/run-as-administrator-lost-ark-1.jpg)
4. Click the**Apply** \>**OK** button.

5. Relaunch the game and check you have sound or not.

### Fix 5: Verify game files

 Verify your game files would scan and repair the game files to make sure the game won’t crash or cause trouble. It’s a quick and easy fix when you encounter game issues.

1. Launch Steam and find Lost Ark in your library. Right-click the game then click **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Steam-right-click-Properties.jpg)
