## Steam Controllers Not Detected in Windows? Here Are the Solutions

Steam not recognizing your controller? You’re definitely not alone. Many players have been reporting the same issue. However, according to our users, this problem might not be so hard to fix at all.

## Try these fixes

 You might not need to try them all. Simply move down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. [**Make sure your controller is working**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Update all your drivers**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Disable Steam configuration in Big Picture**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Update your Steam client**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. **[Install all Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Make sure your controller is working

 Before working with your computer, first you need to**make sure your controller is functioning** . Check if your controller is fully charged if on wireless connection, and maybe change the USB cable if on wired connection. And if possible, test your controller on another console or PC.

 If you’re sure the problem doesn’t come from the controller, try the following to troubleshoot PC configurations.

### Fix 2: Update all your drivers

 One of the common causes of the controller issues is that you’re using**broken or outdated computer drivers** . For your controller to work with Steam with zero error, make sure your PC has the latest drivers installed.

 There’re 2 ways you can update your drivers: manually or automatically.

**Manually** – You can go to the manufacturer’s website of your computer or motherboard, search for the driver according to your Windows version and download it manually.

**Automatically** (Recommended) – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your network driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the exact correct network drivers corresponding with your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

 Once you’ve updated all the drivers, reboot your PC and check if your controller is working now.

 If the latest drivers didn’t give you luck, simply continue to the next fix.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
