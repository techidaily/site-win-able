## Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Graphics driver is essential to the functioning of video games. The outdated or broken graphics driver often crashes the game.

![Disable Steam Overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Disable-Steam-Overlay.jpg)

 If you’re using other apps with overlay features like Discord, Nvidia GeForce Experience, Twitch, etc., ensure that you’ve disabled the in-game overlay in those apps feature before you restart the game.
