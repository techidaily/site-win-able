## Overcoming Performance Hitches for a Smoother Playthrough of Dying Light FPS

If you got frame drops during the game for no reason, don’t worry, you’re not alone. This post has gathered all fixes that have been proved by other players.

 If you’re playing with a laptop, make sure you plugged in and charging while you play. Playing with charing makes a huge difference. Also, make sure you’ve met the minimum system requirement.

| **OS**               | Windows® 7 64-bit / Windows® 8 64-bit / Windows® 8.1 64-bit                  |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor**        | Intel® Core™ i5-2500 @3.3 GHz / AMD FX-8320 @3.5 GHz                         |
| **Graphics**         | NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 560 / AMD Radeon™ HD 6870 (1GB VRAM)                    |
| **Memory**           | 4 GB RAM DDR3                                                                |
| **Hard Drive**       | 40 GB free space                                                             |
| **Additional Notes** | Laptop versions of graphics cards may work but are NOT officially supported. |

## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

## Fix 1: Switch programs & move the game to SSD

 This tip is from a player who figured out if his frames drop, he can use the**Alt+Tab** shortcut to switch out and back in. After that, the game starts running flawlessly.

 Did you install the game in HDD or SSD? We recommend installing the game on SSD so the problem might go.

 Since the FPS issue varies from person to person, we can’t promise this tip is working for everyone, but it’s worth trying.

## Fix 2: Lower video settings

 Lowering some of the video settings would fix the FPS issue in some situations. Make sure you’ve closed all unnecessary programs running in the background before launching the game.

| **Resolution**            | 1366X768 |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| **Full Screen**           | OFF      |
| **Borderless Window**     | ON       |
| **Frame Rate Cap**        | UNCAPPED |
| **View Distance**         | LOW      |
| **Vsync**                 | OFF      |
| **Nvidia Depth of Field** | OFF      |

 It’s suggested to disable all NVIDIA options in the settings. These drain a lot of performance.

If this fix doesn’t help, move to the next fix.

## Fix 4: Update your driver

 Graphic card and its driver are related to the FPS issue. The outdated or wrongly installed driver might be the culprit of the issue. Therefore, make sure you have the latest drivers installed on your computer is important. What’s more, updating your drivers would improve your computer performance.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 You can spend some time updating drivers manually by visiting your GPU manufacturer’s official websites and search for the latest driver which suits your operating system.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your video drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

## Fix 5: Change priority

 Some players found changing the game priority would fix the FPS issue. Although some players said it’s a partial fix, it’s worth trying. Follow the steps below to get rid of the FPS drop issue.

1. Press the**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** together to open Task Manager.
2. Go to the**Details** tab and find the DyingLightGame.exe file.
3. Right-click on it and select**Set priority > Realtime** or**High** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/2021-04-07_16-56-17.jpg)
4. Reboot the game and change Game Settings to**Windowed Full-Screen** mode.
5. Check the FPS.

 Next time, check the priority settings in the Task Manager before you play. Because it sometimes changes back to Normal.

If it’s not working, move to the next fix.

## Fix 6: Verify the game files

 Sometimes there’re some missing files that cause the FPS drop issue. You can fix it by Verify the game files.

1. Launch Steam.
2. Right-click on Dying Light and select**Properties** .
