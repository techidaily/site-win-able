 If you're looking to move a column or a row to a different location in your spreadsheet, you have multiple options to do that in Microsoft Excel. We'll show you what those options are.

 To use any of the below methods, first, open your spreadsheet with Microsoft Excel on your Windows or Mac computer.

##  How to Move a Column in Excel

 To move a column in an Excel spreadsheet, use either [drag and drop](https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/mastering-complex-video-effects-and-transitions-in-gopro-studio/) or the cut and paste method.

###  Move a Column With Drag and Drop

 With Excel's drag and drop method, you can move your columns around just by dragging and dropping them.

 To use this method, first, find the column you want to move in your spreadsheet. At the top of this column, click the column letter so the entire column is selected.

![Select a column in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1-select-column.png) 

 Use your mouse or trackpad to bring the cursor to the border of the column. This turns your cursor into a four-arrow icon.

 While your cursor is a four-arrow icon, press and hold the Shift key on your keyboard. Then drag the column to its new location in your spreadsheet. Excel will place your column to the left of the column where you drop it.

###  Move a Column With Cut and Paste

 Another way to move a column in your spreadsheet is by cutting and pasting the column.

 To use this method, find the column you want to move in your spreadsheet. Right-click the letter at the top of this column and select "Cut" from the menu.

![Right-click the column letter and select "Cut" in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/5-cut-column.png) 

 You'll see an animated dotted line around your selected column. This confirms your column is successfully cut.

![An animated dotted line around a column in Excel.](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/6-dotted-line-column.png) 

 Find the column where you want to place your selected column. Excel will place your cut column to the left of this new column. Right-click the letter of this new column and select "Insert Cut Cells" from the menu.

 Your original column will appear to the left of the selected column.
