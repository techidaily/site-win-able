<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Add DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be triggered by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with DayZ.

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.

 See if you can run DayZ without crashes. If not, try the next fix below to reinstall the game.

### Fix 7: Reinstall DayZ

 If none of the fixes works, you may need to reinstall DayZ to fix this issue. To reinstall DayZ:

1. Open Steam and go to **LIBRARY** .
2. **Right-click** DayZ and select **Delete Local Content…** . to uninstall the game.
