### Fix 1: Uninstall incompatible software

 Sometimes the third party software can interfere with your game. So uninstall the newly installed software to see whether it can help. If you have Razer Chroma SDK, Razer Synapse or Roccat Mouse driver installed on your PC, you’d better uninstall it and see whether it solves the Frostpunk crash issue.  
 Except for these drivers, your antivirus software may be the reason for the Frostpunk crash issue. So, disable your antivirus software and try downloading again to check if the issue persists.

 If this resolves your problem, you may need to replace your antivirus software or contact the vendor of the software for advice.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus software is disabled.

### Fix 2: Reinstall the game

 Fully uninstalling and reinstalling the game is an old easy but effective method. The game profile can be crashed which cause the Frostpunk crash. So doing a clean reinstall can fix the issue.

If it doesn’t work, you can move to the next fix.

### Fix 3: Verify games files via Steam

 Verify games files can help you solve some common error. Some users says Frostpunk crash can be solved by this method.

1. Run Steam.
2. Go to the**LIBRARY** .
3. Right-click Frostpunk and choose**Properties** .
4. Click the**LOCAL FILES** tab and choose**Verify Integrity of Game Files** .

5. Relaunch the game and check whether the issue will appear or not.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics card driver

 With outdated or wrong drivers, your game may encounter a crash. So it is very important to update your graphics card drivers. But Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version automatically. Therefore, update your graphics card driver is always a good option.  
 There are two ways to update your drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-frostpunk-crash/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

2. Right-click on the Frostpunk icon and click **Properties** .
3. Under the **Compatibility** tab, tick **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **OK** .
