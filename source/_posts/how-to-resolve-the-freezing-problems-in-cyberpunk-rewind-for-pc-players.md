 If this fix doesnâ€™t give you any luck, please move on to the next one.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 In some cases, youâ€™ll have glitches during the game if youâ€™re using a**faulty or outdated graphics driver** . Thatâ€™s why updating your graphics driver is usually the thumb rule when troubleshooting game errors. Driver updates not only repair bugs but often come with a performance boost.**Updating your graphics driver** could be a potential fix to the freezing issue.

 You can update your graphics drivers manually, by going to the manufacturerâ€™s website ([**NVIDIA**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   **/[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  ) and searching for the most recent correct driver. If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  :

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you donâ€™t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

### Fix 4: Verify your game files

 Corrupted game files can also cause your game to behave abnormally. So you can run some tests to verify the integrity of your game files.

And hereâ€™s how to do it:

1. Open the Steam client and navigate to the**LIBRARY** tab.**Right-click** Fall Guys and select **Properties** .
2. Navigate to the**LOCAL FILES** tab and click**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILESâ€¦** . Then wait until the process to complete.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fall-guys-verify-game-files.jpg)
3. Launch Fall Guys and test your gameplay.

If the issue reappears, simply check out the next method.

### Fix 5: Stop overclocking your hardware

 Many people would like to exploit the full potential of their hardware by overclocking. Itâ€™s true that overclocking gives you a zero-cost performance boost, but the instability it brings along is also prominent.

 If youâ€™re overclocking your CPU or GPU, you can try stopping it before launching Fall Guys, by closing apps like**MSI Afterburner** and**Intel XTU** or by**restoring BIOS settings** .

If youâ€™re not overclocking, go on and try the next fix.

### Fix 6: Disable your peripherals

 If youâ€™re using peripherals (e.g. controllers) with Fall Guys, try disabling them before starting the game. Thereâ€™re reports that gamers stop having crashes or freezes after disconnecting their peripherals.

 This usually indicates a driver issue with your peripherals. You can try installing or updating drivers for your peripherals, either by visiting the manufacturerâ€™s website, or by using[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , a smart driver downloader.

 If the freezing issue is not peripheral-related, take a look at the last method.

### Fix 7: Check if itâ€™s a server problem

 If you tried all the methods above and none of them works, you should then check if itâ€™s just a server problem. Fall Guys is still a new game, and the surge of players could crash the server from time to time. You can check out the[Fall Guys Server Owl Twitter](https://twitter.com/fallguysowl?lang=en) to see if the serverâ€™s down. Or you can visit the[Fall Guys support page](https://support.fallguys.com/hc/en-us) and consult the staff.

 So these are the solutions to your Fall Guys freezing issue. Hopefully, your game has stopped freezing and you can easily grab a crown now. As always, if you got any questions or suggestions, please feel free to leave a message.
