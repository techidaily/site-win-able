 Many people reported that**Fortnite won’t load** , or**Fortnite is not loading** or**stuck on loading screen** , this is frustrating. But don’t worry. You can fix Fortnite not loading issue.

**Why won’t Fortnite load?** It’s likely that there are buggy issues in your game that stop your game from loading. Meanwhile your graphics card issue can also cause the Fortnite freezes on loading screen. Sometimes it’s hard to identify the reason, but there’s something you can do to fix it.

## Try these fixes

 Here are some solutions you can try. You don’t have to try them all; just work you way down the list until your Fortnite is running again.

1. [Reinstall Fortnite in your computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Set your graphics settings to Low](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

4. [Run Fortnite as administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Configure your computer settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

 Note: the screenshots below come from Windows 10, and fixes also work on Windows 8 and Windows 7.

### Fix 1: Reinstall Fortnite in your computer

 Since many technical problems can be resolved by restarting, it never hurts to**restart your device** , then open Fortnite again to see if it fixes the Fortnite not loading problem.

 If your Fortnite still won’t load, or stuck on the loading screen, try reinstalling your game.

 As there may be update or patch for Fortnite, you can**reinstall your Fortnite** to the latest version. This should fix some buggy issues and hopefully resolve your Fortnite loading issues.

 Note: Be sure to meet the **[system requirements](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to install and play Fortnite in your computer, as the insufficient system resources will fail to load your Fortnite.

 If your problem still persists, don’t worry. There are other solutions.

### Fix 2: Set your graphics settings to Low

 If your game settings is set High, it’s possible that your Fortnite is not loading, since the graphics settings are too much to load for your computer. So you should set your Fortnite graphics settings to Low.

To do so, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Fortnite**Settings** \>**Video Settings** .
2. Check the following video settings and adjust them respectively:  
   * **Display Resolution** : set to the same resolution to the resolution as your display in your computer  
   * **Quality** : low or medium  
   * **View Distance** : medium or far  
   * **Shadows** : off  
   * **Anti-Aliasing** : off  
   * **Textures** : low  
   * **Effects** : low  
   * **Show** **FPS** : On

### Fix 3: Update your graphics card driver

 The missing or outdated drivers in your computer can cause Fortnite won’t load, especially your graphics card driver and your network adapter driver. So you should verify that your graphics card drivers are up to date.

 There are two ways to update your drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manually update drivers** – You can manually update your drivers by downloading the latest version of your drivers from manufacturers, and installing it in your computer. This requires time and computer skills.

**Automatically update drivers** – If you don’t have time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5be920abeeb8a.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to your device to automatically download the latest drivers (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Then install the drivers in your computer.  
 Or click**Update All** the automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5be920cf0d891.jpg)
4. Restart your computer to take effect.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Then launch Fortnite in your computer and see if it fixes your Fortnite not loading issues.

Still no luck? Okay, there’s something else to try.

### Fix 4: Run Fortnite as administrator

 Runing your game as administrator can grant admin rights to run your game in your computer, and this will hopefully fix Fortnite not loading problem.

1. Open File Explorer, and go to the folder where your Fortnite was installed.
2. Right click on the**Fortnite executable** and select**Run as administrator** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5be9213d5616f.jpg)
3. Click**Yes** to verify the UAC. If you’re prompted to enter your admin account and password, enter the information.
4. Then you can run your Fortnite as admin.

Check if your game can load properly.

### Fix 5: Configure your computer settings

 Your PC settings problem can be one of the possible causes for Fortnite not loading. If your computer is not configured properly, you can’t make full use of your system sources and will have the Fortnite not loading issue.

Below lists out some PC settings you can configure:

#### 1\. Change the number of boot processors

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the**Run** box.
