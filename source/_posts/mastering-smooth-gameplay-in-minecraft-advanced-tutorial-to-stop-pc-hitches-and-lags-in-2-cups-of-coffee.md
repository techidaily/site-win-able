 You may need to upgrade the hardware of your computer if it fails to meet the system requirement of League of Legends.

 If your PC meets the system requirement for League of Legends but the game crashing issue persists, try the next fix, below.

### Fix 2: Update your drivers

 A missing or outdated driver may also trigger the game crashing issue. If it’s the case, this issue can be easily resolved after you update your drivers.

 There are two ways to update your driver:**manually** and **automatically** .

**Update your drivers manually** – You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest drivers for your computer.

 Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your exact PC model and your version of Windows.

 **Or**

**Update your drivers automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all** .

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-83.png)

 3) Click**Update** next to any device to automatically download the correct version of its driver, then you can install it manually. Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

 This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All.**  You get **full support** and a **30-day money back** guarantee.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/image-84.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

 If you need assistance, please contact**Driver Easy’s support team** at [**support@drivereasy.com**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

### Fix 3: Install the latest Windows Updates

 One of the the dependencies of League of Legends is**DotNet Framework 3.5** . By installing the latest Windows Updates, you can also update DotNet Framework 3.5 to the latest version. If you’re using Windows 10, you can follow the steps below to perform Windows Update:

1) Launch League of Legends and log in.

2) In the upper-right corner, click**the gear button**  to open the game settings.
