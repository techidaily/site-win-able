* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**
* **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**

**Automatically –**  If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

### Step 2: Lower in-game graphics settings

 By defualt, It Takes Two will automatically select the graphics settings that suits your hardware. If you want to get some extra FPS and performance, you can play with the graphics settings in the game.

 Normally, the in-game PFS will increase after you lower some in-game graphics settings.

 If the FPS still doesn’t improved after you optimized the graphics settings, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 5: Disable background recording and Xbox Game Bar

 Microsoft introduces many gaming features to Windows 10, such as background recording, Xbox Game Bar, etc.. Once enabled, they’ll constantly run in the background, hogging a ton of resources.

 If you’ve enabled background recording and Xbox Game Bar, try disabling them to see if the in-game FPS will improve. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press**the Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open**Windows Settings** . Click**Gaming** to open Windows 10 gaming settings.  
![Windows 10 settings gaming](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Windows-10-settings-gaming.jpg)
2. **Turn off** the toggle under**Xbox Game Bar** if it is turned on.  
![Turn off Xbox Game Bar](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Turn-off-Xbox-Game-Bar.jpg)
3. Click**Captures** on the left, then**turn off** the toggle udner**Background recording** if it is turned on.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 6: Close other demanding apps running in the background

 The It Takes Two FPS dropping issue may occur if too many applications or programs are running at the same time in the background. So **try restricting applications and downloads in the background** before playing the game to see if the game would run smoothly. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **Ctrl** , **Shift** and **Esc** at the same time to open **Task Manager** . You will be prompted for permission. Click **Yes** to open Task Manager.
2. Select any other applications and programs that take up a large amount of **CPU** , **memory** and **network**  and then click **End task**  to close it.  
![Restrict applications and downloads in the background](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Task-Manager.jpg)

 Launch It Takes Two to see if the in-game FPS increases. If not, try the next fix, below.

## Fix 7: Set the Power Plan of your PC for Best Performance

 A power plan is a collection of hardware and system settings that manages how your computer use power. In most cases, the power plan on PCs are configured to **Balanced** , which may limits the operating capacity of your graphics card and CPU.

 Windows 10 allows you to customize the power plan on your PC. If the power plan of your PC is **Power saver**  or **Balanced** and you’re experiencing the FPS dropping issue, try setting the Power Plan of your PC for Best Performance. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time, then type **powercfg.cpl** and press **Enter** .  
![run dialog - powercfg.cpl](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/run-dialog-powercfg.png)
2. In the pop-up window, expand **Hide additional plans** and select **High performance** .  
![control panel power options](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/control-panel-power-options.png)
