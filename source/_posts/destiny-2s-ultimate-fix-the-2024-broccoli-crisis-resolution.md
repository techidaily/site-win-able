## Fix 1: Check if your PC meets the minimum requirements for Destiny 2

 The Destiny 2 broccoli error may point to a system that does that meet the minimum requirements for the game. So before attempting anything more advanced, you should compare your system to the officially suggested specifications to see if your PC is powerful enough to run the game.

Here’s how:

| **MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS** | **RECOMMENDED SPECIFICATIONS**                                                   |                                                                             |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OPERATING SYSTEM**       | Windows 7, 8, or Windows 10 64-bit                                               | Windows 7, 8, or Windows 10 64-bit                                          |
| **CPU**                    | Intel Core i3 3250 3.5 GHz or Intel Pentium G4560 3.5 GHz or AMD FX-4350 4.2 GHz | Intel Core i5 2400 3.4 GHz or i5 7400 3.5 GHz or AMD Ryzen R5 1600X 3.6 GHz |
| **GPU**                    | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 660 2GB or GTX 1050 2GB or AMD Radeon HD 7850 2GB             | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4GB or GTX 1060 6GB or AMD R9 390 8GB                |
| **RAM**                    | 6 GB                                                                             | 8 GB                                                                        |
| **HDD**                    | 104GB free space                                                                 | 104GB free space                                                            |

## Fix 6: Stop overclocking

 Many players would overclock their CPU or GPU to crank out extra performance out of the existing system. The downside is that, high clock speed may induce stability issues and even crashes to your system.

 If your game starts to crash after you’ve overclocked your CPU or GPU, try reverting it to the default setting. After that, fire up Destiny 2 to see if the crashing issues have ceased.
