 Alternatively, you can go to[**VRChat’s official website**](https://www.vrchat.com/) . Log in and go to the**AVATARS** tab and select the**Reset to Default Avatar** option.

## Fix 2: Verify your game files

 If VRChat keeps crashing while other games run perfectly, the culprit could be corrupt game files. Try verifying your VRchat game files in Steam:

1. Go to **Library** .
2. Right-click VRChat and select **Properties** .

## Fix 5: Delete VRChat files

 VRChat official has provided an automatic method for users who are experiencing VRChat crashing or VRChat not launching issues. All you need is to run Command Prompt as administrator and run a few commands:

1. On your Windows search bar, type **cmd** . Right-click Command Prompt from the results and select **Run as administrator** .  
![how to open Command Prompt as an admin](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/win11-Command-Prompt-Run-as-administrator.jpg)  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2084396/18498" target="_top" id="2084396"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2084396" border="0" alt="" width="1920" height="700"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2084396/18498" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 You’ll be prompted for permission. Click **Yes** to open the Command Prompt.
2. Copy this command with**Ctrl + C** , and paste it into the cmd window by right-clicking in the window.  

` **rmdir /S /Q %AppData%..LocalLowVRChatvrchatCookies && rmdir /S /Q %AppData%..LocalLowVRChatvrchatHTTPCache && rmdir /S /Q %AppData%..LocalLowVRChatvrchatUnity && rmdir /S /Q %AppData%..LocalLowVRChatvrchatVRCHTTPCache && rmdir /S /Q %TEMP%VRChat && REG DELETE HKCUSoftwareVRChatvrchat /va** `
3. Press**Enter** to run this command.
4. When prompted for permission to delete all keys under the VRChat key, press**Y** and hit**Enter** .
5. If this command gives you error messages such as not finding the exact file path, you can run the following command in cmd to clear the VRChat cache:  

` **rmdir /S /Q %USERPROFILE%AppDataLocalLowVRChatvrchat && rmdir /S /Q %TEMP%VRChat && REG DELETE HKCUSoftwareVRChatvrchat /va** `

 The first command includes multiple commands in a single line by putting && in between them.

 After clearing the cache, you can check if the VRChat crashing still persists.

 You can also check its **[support article](https://help.vrchat.com/kb/article/17-i-crashedcant-launch-vrchatother-issues/)**  to learn how to do it manually if the command doesn’t work for you.

## Fix 6: Create a VRChat account

 If the methods above failed to help, then you can try creating a new VRChat account then link your Steam/Oculus account with your VRChat account on[VRChat official website](https://www.vrchat.com/) .

To merge your Steam account with your VRChat account:

1. Log into VRChat with your Steam/Oculus account.
2. Open your quick menu, then select**Settings** .
3. Click**Upgrade Account** near the bottom of that menu, then follow the instructions on the screen to merge your accounts.

## Fix 7: Turn off SteamVR Beta

 SteamVR is the ultimate tool for experiencing VR content on the hardware of your choice. However, many users reported that SteamVR Beta has caused their VRChat to crash.

 You can either turn off SteamVR Beta or roll it back to a more stable version.

## Fix 8: Use VPN

 Sadly, for many users, the only solution is using a VPN. This is mainly because your ISP has filtered or throttled your internet connection for VRChat, thus causing your VRChat to crash randomly.

 If all of these fixes fail, the last resort is using a VPN to connect to VRChat. We suggest **[Nord VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  as it’s the most powerful and secure VPN at a reasonable price, and you can get **[Nord VPN coupons](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to save up to 83% of your money.

 Be careful about free VPN services, although it definitely sounds good about what they claim: **100% FREE and SAFE** , the reality is always the opposite. They will make money out of you later on.
