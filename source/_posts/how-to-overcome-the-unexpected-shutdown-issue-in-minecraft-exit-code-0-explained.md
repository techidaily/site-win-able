### Method 5: Run a System File Checker

 The corrupted system file may cause Microsoft Edge to crash. To solve it, you can use the 2 ways to repair the broken system files.

* [Option 1- Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-microsoft-edge-crashing-problem-on-windows-10/#reimage)  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of Windows common issues. It will deal with issues related to system errors, and critical system files and find the right fix for you.
* Option 2 – Manually  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there are any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

#### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your computer and fix them immediately.

 It is tailored to your specific system and is working in a private and automatic way. It will first check hardware-related issues to identify problems, and then security issues, and finally it detects programs that crash, and missing system files. Once complete, it will find a solution to your specific problem.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-1.jpg)
3. Fortect will scan your computer thoroughly. This may take a few minutes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-2.jpg)
4. Once done, you’ll see a detailed report of all the issues on your PC. To fix them automatically, click**Start Repair** . This requires you to purchase the full version. But don’t worry. If Fortect doesn’t solve the issue, you can request a refund within 60 days.

 Email: **<support@fortect.com>**

#### Option 2 – Manually

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** key at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type “cmd” and press **Shift** +**Ctrl** +**Enter** together to open Command Prompt in the administrator mode.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/command-prompt-1.jpg)  
**Note** : Do **NOT** click OK or just press the Enter key as that won’t allow you to open Command Prompt in the administrator mode.

3. Type “sfc /scannow” in the window and press **Enter** . Then wait for the verification is 100% complete.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Snap4.jpg)
4. Reboot your computer to check the changes.

 If the result indicates that there are broken files exist but SFC can’t fix them, you can turn to Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) Tool for deeper examination and repair.
