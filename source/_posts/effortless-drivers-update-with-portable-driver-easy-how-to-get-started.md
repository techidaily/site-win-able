### Fix 2: Update available device drivers

 The missing or outdated device drivers in your computer result in lags or stuttering in your game, for instance, your graphics card driver issue has something to do with FPS in your game and your network adapter driver problem has something to do with your Internet lagging. To rule it out as the cause, you should verify that device drivers are up to date, and update those that aren’t.

 There are two ways to update your drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

**Manually update drivers** – You can go to the device manufacturer’s website, search for the latest version of your driver, then manually download and install it in your computer. This requires the time and computer skills.

**Automatically update drivers** – If you don’t have the time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
