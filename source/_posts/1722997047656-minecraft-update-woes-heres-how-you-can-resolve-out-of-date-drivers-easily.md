## Check service status

 You’d better check Grand Theft Auto Online service status before going to any fixes. If it’s a service issue, none of the fixes will work for you.

 Go to the[service status](https://support.rockstargames.com/servicestatus) site, if you see green lights, it means the server is working properly. The issue is on your end.

## Reboot your router

 Make sure your internet is working properly. If there’s something wrong with your network, you’re not able to play GTA 5 online.

 Power cycling your router and connect it again with your devices. If your internet is not working, reset your router may help.

 Contact your local ISP service for more information if your internet still not working.

## Try these fixes

 If the problem is nothing to do with the game server nor internet, you should focus on your devices.

* [Console](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### For Console

1. [Restart your console](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Check your subscription](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Change DNS settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

#### 1\. Restart your console

 This tip is from PS5 players, PS5 users reported restarting the console again would make the game started working. But this fix also works on PS4 and Xbox. Because when the game CD is corrupt or there’s an issue with the local game settings inside your console, a force restart usually can fix it.

#### 2\. Check your subscription

 It’s commonly found that your PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold subscription has expired. So check your subscription first, if that’s the case, just signed up and make a resubscription.

 For Xbox users, there’s another situation that your Xbox Live Gold subscription information is conflicting on your console. By removing your Xbox Live account from the console and readd it, the problem could be solved. Of course, make sure you have the right email and password.

#### 3\. Change DNS settings ( for PS4 users)

PS4 users can change DNS settings to solve the issue. Here’s how:

From the Home Screen of your PS4, follow these steps:

1. Launch PS4.
2. From the Home screen of PS4, navigate to**Settings** .
3. Select**Network** .
4. Select**Set Up Internet Connection** .
5. Select**Manual** .
6. Under DNS Settings, use the following settings.  
**Primary** 84.200.69.80  
**Secondary** 84.200.70.40
7. Reboot your PS4 console and check the game.

 If the above fixes didn’t help, you can contact the[Rockstar Support team](https://support.rockstargames.com/categories/200013306) for more information. It’s quite rare but when your account has been banned by Rockstar, you can’t log in to the game and you won’t know till you contact the support team.

### For PC

1. [Get a bigger SSD](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Close the game app completely](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Update your network driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Use a VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

#### 1\. Get a bigger SSD

 If your game is on a hard drive which don’t have enough space, you probably need to wait longer for loading.

You can either be patient, or buy a bigger SSD to replace the old one.

#### 2\. Close GTA 5 completely

 When you’re stuck at an infinite loading screen, you can fix the problem by closing GTA 5 completely. It’s because there are chances that the game has an error start that leads to the GTA 5 not working issue. This problem usually happens to game engines such as Steam.

1. Press the**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** key together to open**Task Manager** .
2. Click the**Performance** tab.
3. Click**Open Resource Monitor** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/2021-02-05_12-02-24.jpg)
4. Shut down all the GTA 5 services.

5. Reboot your computer and launch the game to check.

#### 3\. Update your network driver

 Driver is an important part of your computer, if the driver is corrupted or outdated, your network won’t work properly which leads to the GTA 5 online not working problem. But Windows won’t give you the latest driver.  
 Don’t worry, there’re two ways to update your driver: manually or automatically.

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics card, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 A**utomatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update your network driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact network adapter, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

#### 4\. Use a VPN

 The error message “Your profile does not have permission to access GTA Online” or “The services are unavailable” must confuse you. This kind of error message definitely ruins your mood but don’t worry, using a VPN may help you get rid of it.

 You can use the VPN you already have, if you don’t have one, it’s recommended to use [**NordVPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

[**NordVPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) is a famous brand. Its server location covers 60 countries and the safety of this VPN is absolutely stunning. Also, it has a fast speed that can meet your needs.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  NordVPN on your device.
2. Run NordVPN and open it.
3. Connect to a server in a chosen location.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/nord.jpg)
4. Relaunch GTA 5 online.

 By the way, you can temporarily disable your firewalls, antivirus software to make sure it’s not your firewall blocking part of the game and cause the problem. Make sure that “GTAV.exe” is unblocked.

 Please be aware of any suspicious links or websites when you disabled your firewalls and antivirus software.
