### Fix 1: Make sure your PC specs meet the requirements

 It’s a bit cliché. But still, your PC specs are a decisive factor for your gaming experience. Besides, Horizon Zero Dawn is a demanding game. Having a decent setup definitely gives you a leg up on playing AAA titles.

#### Minimum requirements for Horizon Zero Dawn

| **OS:**        | Windows 10 64-bits                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor:** | Intel Core <i5-2500K@3.3GHz> or AMD FX <6300@3.5GHz>         |
| **Memory:**    | 8 GB RAM                                                 |
| **Graphics:**  | Nvidia GeForce GTX 780 (3 GB) or AMD Radeon R9 290 (4GB) |
| **DirectX:**   | Version 12                                               |

#### Recommended requirements for Horizon Zero Dawn

| **OS:**        | Windows 10 64-bits                                        |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor:** | Intel Core <i7-4770K@3.5GHz> or Ryzen 5 <1500X@3.5GHz>        |
| **Memory:**    | 16 GB RAM                                                 |
| **Graphics:**  | Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 (6 GB) or AMD Radeon RX 580 (8GB) |
| **DirectX:**   | Version 12                                                |

 If your rigs are powerful enough for the game, you can move on to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Verify game files on Steam

 The constant crashes may indicate an integrity issue with your game files (It’s not a surprising problem, especially with AAA titles that take up almost 100GB of your disk). You can follow these steps to check:

1. Open your Steam client and go to your**LIBRARY** . From the left menu, right-click**Horizon Zero Dawn** and select**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hzd-verify-game-1.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the**LOCAL FILES** tab and select**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** . Then wait for the checking to complete.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hzd-verify-game-2.jpg)

Once done, launch Horizon Zero Dawn and check if it crashes again.

 If verifying game files doesn’t help your case, take a look at the next fix.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes to the crash is a**faulty or outdated GPU driver** . Graphics card manufacturers release new drivers on a regular basis, addressing compatibility issues and improving gaming experience. If the last time you updated drivers feels like ages ago, definitely do it now as it might save your day.

 There’re mainly 2 ways you can update your graphics driver: manually or automatically.

#### Option 1: Update your graphics driver manually

 To manually update your graphics driver, first go to your graphics card manufacturer’s website:

* **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**

 Then search for your exact GPU model. Be sure to download the latest correct installer that’s compatible with your operating system. Once downloaded, follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2: Update your graphics driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/de-update-all-rtx-3080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

### Fix 4: Disable in-game overlays

**In-game overlay** is a platform feature that allows you to interact, unlock achievements and make purchases. Though convenient, in-game overlay could trigger compatibility issues with the game. So you can try disabling it and see how things go.

And here’s a quick guide to disable Steam overlay:

1. At the top-left corner of your Steam client, click**Steam** and select**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/disable-steam-overlay-1.jpg)
2. From the left menu, select**In-Game** . Under the**Steam Overlay** section, uncheck these boxes. Then click**OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/disabel-steam-overlay.jpg)

Now you can start Horizon Zero Dawn and see if it crashes again.

 If this method doesn’t give you luck, simply check out the next one.

### Fix 5: Install all Windows updates

 Windows 10 includes two types of updates, one tackles security issues and another offers a periodical performance boost. Keeping your system up-to-date can save you a lot of troubles.

So here’s how to check for updates manually:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** (the i key) at the same time to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-setting-app-security-update.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Then wait for Windows to download and install available updates.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

 To make sure you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** again.

 If this trick doesn’t work for you, simply move on to the next one.

### Fix 6: Change in-game display mode

 Some users reported that they managed to stop the crash by changing the display mode to**Borderless** . You can give this a try as it might also be the solution for you.

Here’s how:

1. Open Horizon Zero Dawn and go to**Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hzd-display-mode-1.jpg)
2. Navigate to the**DISPLAY** tab and set**Display mode** to**Borderless** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hzd-display-mode-2.jpg)
3. Restart your game and test the gameplay.

### Fix 7: Increase virtual memory

 In simpler terms,**virtual memory** serves as an additional RAM when your physical memory runs out. Increasing the virtual memory could be helpful when playing large, graphically demanding games.

You can use this guide to increase your virtual memory:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and type **advanced system settings** . Click **View advanced system settings** .

5. Enter **Initial size** and **Maximum size** according to the physical memory of your computer. Microsoft recommends that virtual memory should be 1.5 to 3 times the size of physical memory. In my case, the physical memory of my computer is 8 GB, so the **Initial size** for me here is **8 x 1024 x 1.5 = 12288 MB** , and the **Maximum size** should be **8 x 1024 x 3 = 24576 MB** . Once you’ve entered your size of virtual memory, click **Set** , then click **OK**  to save the changes.

### Fix 8: Enable HAGS (GeForce 10 series or later/Radeon 5600 or 5700 series)
