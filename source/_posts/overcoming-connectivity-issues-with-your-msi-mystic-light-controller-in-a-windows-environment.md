![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/mystic-light-featured.jpg)

 Mystic Light is a lighting control utility that allows you to create an immersive gaming experience with your RGB hardware. But before that, you need to get it to work. Many users are reporting a**Mystic Light not working** issue. If you happen to be one of them, here’re some working fixes you can try.

## Try these fixes

 You might not need to try them all. Simply work down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. [**Check your hardware connection**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [**Reinstall Mystic Light completely**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [**Update your device drivers**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [**Install all Windows updates**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [**Make sure to disable anti-cheats**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. **[Check for corrupted system files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Check your hardware connection

 Before changing anything in your system, you need to make sure there’s nothing wrong with your hardware. You can refer to the manual and check the**LED connector** on your motherboard, or test the hardware on another PC to see if you need to RMA the product.

### Fix 2: Reinstall Mystic Light completely

 This issue may suggest a misconfiguration or a faulty installation. Either way, you can try to solve the problem with a clean reinstall.

 Mystic Light is a component of**MSI Center** or**Dragon Center (UWP)** , so in fact you’ll be reinstalling one of these two programs.

 For example,**here’s how you can reinstall Dragon Center** :

1. First you need to**purge Dragon Center from your system** . On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the I key) and click Apps.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/windows-settings-apps.jpg)
2. Under**Apps & features** , click the input box and type**Dragon Center** . Select**Dragon Center** and click**Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/remove-dc-1.jpg)
3. Next, search and uninstall**MSI SDK** . Then restart your PC.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/remove-dc-2.jpg)
4. You can now use the installer from the official site. Or you can install via Microsoft Store. To do that, on the bottom left corner, click the**Windows icon** and select**Microsoft Store** .

### Fix 3: Update your device drivers

 More often than not, the Mystic Light not working issue could indicate a faulty or missing device driver. In addition to healthy hardware, for the ambient lights to work properly, you also need to**make sure you have all the latest necessary drivers** on your rig.

 You can install or update your drivers manually, by visiting the hardware manufacturer’s websites, finding the latest correct drivers and installing them one by one. But if you don’t like playing with computer drivers, you can use[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to scan, repair or update all your drivers automatically.

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/scan-now.jpg)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/de-update-all-realtek-audio.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating all the drivers, restart your PC and check if Mystic Light works now.

 If the latest drivers don’t give you luck, take a look at the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4:**Install all Windows updates**

 In some cases, after you install new hardware, Windows will download compatible drivers and files for the hardware to work. But you also need to check if your system is missing important updates.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then download and install the available patches. It might take some time (up to 30 mins).

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 To confirm you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

Once done, do a reboot and see if

### Fix 5: Make sure to disable anti-cheats

 According to some users, Mystic Light may be blocked by some**anti-cheats** such as**Riot Vanguard** and**FACEIT** . So you can check if you have certain online games installed on your system, like Valorant and CSGO.

 Or you can do a clean boot to start your system with only the essential services and programs to check if it’s a compatibility issue:

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**msconfig** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/msconfig-clean-boot-1.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, navigate to the **Services**  tab and check the box next to **Hide all Microsoft services** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/msconfig-hide-all-windows-services.jpg)
3. **Uncheck**  all the services EXCEPT those belong to your hardware manufacturers, such as **Realtek** , **AMD** , **NVIDIA** ,**Logitech** and **Intel** . Then click **OK**  to apply the changes.
