### Fix 1: Disable your antivirus software

 Some antivirus software (like Bitdefender) may block some features in Minecraft so that you can encounter Unable to connect world issue. If you have installed antivirus software on your computer, you can disable it temporarily and check to see if the problem is resolved.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

 If this resolves your problem, you may need to replace your antivirus software or contact the vendor of the software for advice.

### Fix 2: Verify your game cache

 If your game crashes on XCOM 2 startup, it’s possible that the installation of XCOM 2 is corrupted. Then you can use this fix to redownload files and fix crashes.

1. Run Steam.
2. In the**LIBRARY** tab, right-click on XCOM 2.
3. Under the**LOCAL FILES** tab, click**Verify integrity of game cache** .

4. After the process, relaunch the game and check the crash will appear or not.

### Fix 3: Change your save files location

 If Fix 2 can’t solve your problem, the saved file could be the culprit. When you delete the save file with modded content, the crash can happen. You can transfer the save files into a different location for safekeeping.

 The save files should be located at: “C:\\Users\\YOUR USERNAME\\Documents\\my games\\XCOM2\\XComGame\\SaveData”. Copy files and move to elsewhere and then delete the original SaveData folder.

### Fix 4: Disable Steam Overlay

 The Steam overlay is a piece of Steam user interface that can let users access friend list, web browser and in-game DLC purchasing. This feature is very useful but sometimes it can be the reason for game crash. You can disable it and check whether it could solve the crashes.

1. Run Steam.
2. Right-click on XCOM 2 and click**Properties** .
3. In the **GENERAL**  tab, uncheck “**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** “.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/over.jpg)
4. Relaunch the game and check whether the crash will appear or not.

### Fix 5: Update your driver

 Missing or outdated drivers may also trigger the game crash issues. In this case, you need to update your drivers to resolve this issue.

 There are two ways to update your drivers: **manually** and **automatically** .

**Update your drivers manually** – You can update your drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website, and searching for the latest driver for each device on your PC.Be sure to choose the driver **that’s compatible with your PC model** and **your version of Windows** .

**Or**

**Update your drivers automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 NOTE: **Driver Easy handles it all** . **All the drivers in Driver Easy** come straight from **the manufacturer** . They’re **all certified safe and secure** .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
