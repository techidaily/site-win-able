 Shaders issues in COD titles could mean that you’re using**a broken or outdated graphics driver** . We always recommend gamers to keep their GPU drivers up to date so as to avoid compatibility issues. If you don’t know when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it now.

 You can update your graphics driver manually: first you need to identify your GPU model, then go to the manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ) and search and download the latest correct driver installer. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update manually, you can do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
