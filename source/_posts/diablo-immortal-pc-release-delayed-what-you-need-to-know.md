### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 The Diablo II: Resurrected not launching issue may occur if you’re using a faulty or outdated graphics driver. To fix any compatibility issues with the new games and get the best performance, you should make sure your graphics driver is up to date.

There are two ways for you to update the graphics driver:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website such as[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ,[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics) , and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 5: Check your antivirus settings

 Antivirus and malware checkers may prevent your game from launching, even if the application is legitimate and safe. To rule out this possibility, you can temporarily disable your antivirus.

 If the launching issue is resolved after you disable the antivirus, you’ll need to whitelist the Battle.net launcher and Diablo II: Resurrected. This process will vary depending on the antivirus software you’re using.

But if the game still fails to launch, check out the next fix.

### Fix 6: Perform a clean boot

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type**msconfig** and click**OK** .
