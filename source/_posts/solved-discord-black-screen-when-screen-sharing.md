### Fix 1 – Repair system files

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-3.jpg)

 After the repair completes, test if Oculus Link is back on track. If not, move on to the second fix.

### Fix 2 – Update your device drivers

 The Oculus Link black screen or not working issue can also be driver-related, especially if your graphics driver and USB driver are incompatible, faulty or outdated. Your Oculus devices also require specific drivers. So, to keep your Oculus device in tip-top condition and boost the performance of your VR games, you should update the drivers regularly.

There are mainly two ways you can update the driver:

**Manually** – You can update your device drivers manually by going to the manufacturer’s website and then searching for the most recent correct driver. But be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact Oculus devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-driver-de-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). Or you can click**Update** next to the flagged device driver to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-all-de.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Relaunch Oculus Link to test. If the problem persists, have a look at more fixes below.

### Fix 3 – Adjust the resolution

 If your Oculus Link keeps displaying a black screen, it’s possible that the high resolution is too demanding to your rig, and in this case, you should try lowering the settings.

1. Unplug your Oculus Quest or Rift from the PC.
2. Navigate to the Oculus installation folder which usually locates at**C:\\Program Files\\Oculus** .
3. Open**Support** \>**oculus-diagnostics** . Then, run the**OculusDebugTool.exe** .
4. Lower the**Encode Resolution Width** or you can set the value according to[Oculus’s recommendations](https://forums.oculusvr.com/community/discussion/83561/oculus-link-resolution-with-v12) . (Quite a few users fix the issue by setting the Encode Resolution Width to 2784.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/resolution-settings.jpg)
5. Restart your PC for the changes to take effect.

6. Reboot your Oculus headset and plug it back to the PC.

 Check whether Oculus Link works properly with your VR rig or not. If not, proceed to the next method.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4 – Disable in-game overlay

 More often than not, disabling the in-game overlay feature can make your games or programs run more smoothly. So you could also give it a shot. Below we’ll show you how to do this specifically on GeForce Experience.

1. Open GeForce Experience.
2. Click the**cogwheel icon** at the upper right corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/7-1-1-1.jpg)
3. Turn off**In-game overlay** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
 Restart Oculus Link and your VR devices to see if the problem goes away. Still no luck? Don’t worry; there are two more fixes to try.

### Fix 5 – Opt out of Public Test Channel

 According to[Oculus official support](https://support.oculus.com/200468603765391/) , Oculus Link may not work as intended if you enroll in Public Test Channel. That means you will be testing a beta version of the Oculus software which is possibly unreliable and more likely to run into the black screen issue.

It’s suggested you opt out of the Beta mode and here’s how:

1. Launch Oculus Link.
2. Select**Settings** on the left pane and navigate to the**Beta** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beta-1.jpg)
3. **Toggle off** the button next to Public Test Channel.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/beta-2.jpg)

 Test if Oculus Link returns to the normal state. If not, continue to the next troubleshooting tips.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6 – Use the dedicated graphics card

 You’ll need to plug your Oculus headset into the dedicated graphics card or else the black screen occurs. If the connection is correct and you still have trouble using Oculus Link, follow the steps below to configure the NVIDIA settings.

1. Right-click any empty space on your desktop and select**NVIDIA Control Panel** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-3-1.jpg)
2. On the left pane, select**3D settings** \>**Manage 3D settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/1-4.jpg)
3. Go to the**Program Settings** tab. Then, select your Oculus app from the drop-down list and choose**High-performance NVIDIA processor** below.

<a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042332/17092" target="_top" id="2042332"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2042332" border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="960" height="900"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042332/17092" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
