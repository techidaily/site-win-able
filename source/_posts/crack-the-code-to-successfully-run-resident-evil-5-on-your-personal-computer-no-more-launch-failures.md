1. Restart your computer.
2. Launch Steam and sign in to your account.
3. Navigate to **LIBRARY** , then right click on Resident Evil Village game title and click **Properties…** .

5. Wait a few minutes for Steam to validate the files of the game. Again, any files found missing or corrupt would be automatically downloaded in the process.
6. Re-launch Resident Evil Village to see if the lag problem has been mitigated. If yes, then congrats! If it’s no joy, please try **Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2: Update your device drivers

 The device driver, which works as a translator between your hardware component and the computer, is essential for the functioning of your computer system. You may experience a lag between the cutscene and the voiceline issue if the graphics driver or the audio driver on your computer is wrong, corrupt or outdated. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. **Driver Easy handles it all.**

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the[**FREE**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the **[Pro versio](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [**n**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 steps (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
5. Check to see if the cutscene lag issue is solved. If it doesn’t do the trick, please continue with**Fix 3** , below.

 Fix 3: Adjust your graphics settings

 According to some players, tweaking the in-game settings of Resident Evil Village has helped them resolve the lag issue in Resident Evil Village. You could try it too and see how it goes:

* Vertical sync: Off
* Power Management : Prefer Maximum Performance

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 4: Install the latest patch

 The lagging in cutscene problem could be a bug for RE8 game. If that’s the case, the developers would work on addressing the issue, patching the bug in its new releases. There’s no need for you to download the patch manually, as it would be detected and automatically installed by Steam. You can wait around and see if the issue is fixed.
