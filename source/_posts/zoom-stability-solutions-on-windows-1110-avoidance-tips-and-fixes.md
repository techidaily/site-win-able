| Processor        | **FX-4330 (AMD) or i3-4350 (Intel)**          |
| Memory           | **8GB**                                       |
| Video card       | **Radeon RX 460 / GeForce GTX 660 or better** |
| DirectX          | **11 Compatible video card or equivalent**    |
| Hard-drive space | **48.5 GB**                                   |

**Recommended:**

| Processor        | **FX-4330 (AMD) or i3-4350 (Intel)**           |
| Memory           | **8 GB**                                       |
| Video card       | **Radeon R9 270x / GeForce GTX 670 or better** |

| Hard-drive space | **48.5GB**                                     |

 If you’re not sure whether your PC meets the system requirements for Madden 20 or not, just follow the instructions below to check the specs of your PC:

 1) On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time, then type **dxdiag** and press **Enter** .
