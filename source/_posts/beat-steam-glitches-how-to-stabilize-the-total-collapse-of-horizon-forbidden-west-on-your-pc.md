1. Launch **Steam** and go to your **Library** .
2. **Right-click** on **Aliens: Fireteam Elite** and select **Properties** .

## 4\. Install the latest game patch

 The developer of Aliens: Fireteam Elite releases regular game patches to fix bugs and improve gaming performance. It’s possible that a recent patch has caused the game crash issue, and that a new patch is required to fix it.

 If a patch is available, it will be detected by the Steam client, and the latest game patch will be automatically downloaded and installed when you launch the game.

 Launch Aliens: Fireteam Elite again to check if the game crash issue has been resolved. If it didn’t work, or there was no new game patch available, move on to the next fix, below.

## 5\. Disable steam overlay

 You can try disabling Steam Overlay for Aliens: Fireteam Elite and see if the game crashes again:

1. Launch Steam and navigate to **the LIBRARY tab** . **right-click** on _Aliens: Fireteam Elite_ . Then select **Properties** .  
![Steam game properties](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Steam-game-F1-2020-properties.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![disable steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-steam-overlay.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 6\. Disable real-time protection from your antivirus software

 The real-time protection feature in some 3rd party antivirus software would block the game files, and this may lead to the game crashing issues.

 You can try adding both the game folder and Steam as an exception to your third-party antivirus application, and turn off the real-time protection feature. If necessary, try temporarily disabling your 3rd party antivirus software before playing the game.

 Run Aliens: Fireteam Elite and check if this issue persists after you disabled the anti-virus software on your PC.

If this fix didn’t work, try the next fix to perform a clean boot.

## 7\. Run the System File Checker

 You also need to check the system file if the game still crashes, because the corrupted system files would also crash the game.

 You can run the System File Checker to check and repair the system files. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the **Run** dialog. Type **cmd** and press **Ctrl** , **Shift** , and **Enter** at the same time to open **Command Prompt** as administrator.
2. Type in the command below and press Enter to execute the command. The process will take some time.  
**`sfc /scannow`**  
![run system file checker](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/run-system-file-checker.jpg)
3. Close the Command Prompt window after the process is complete.

 Launch the game and see if it crashes. If this fix doesn’t work, try the next one, below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 8\. Stop overclocking

 Some players may try overclocking the CPU or turbo boost the graphics card to gain a better FPS. However, overclocking often crashes the game.

 To reduce the frequency of game crashing issues, you should reset the CPU or the graphics card to the manufacturer specifications.

## 9\. Perform a clean boot

 If there is a certain application conflicting with Aliens: Fireteam Elite, the game would also crash. You can perform a clean boot to find out the problematic application that crashes the game. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run Dialog. Type **msconfig** and press **Enter** to open the **System Configuration** window.  
![msconfig-win-10](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/msconfig-win-10.png)
2. Navigate to the **Services** tab, check **Hide all Microsoft services** and then click **Disable all** .  
![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration.png)
3. Select the **Startup** tab and click **Open Task Manager** .  
![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration2.png)
4. On the **Startup** tab in **Task Manager** , for **each** startup item, select the item and then click **Disable** .  
![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration3.png)
5. Go back to the **System Configuration** window and click **OK** .  
![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration4.png)
6. Click **Restart** to restart your PC.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![system configuration](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/system-configuration5.png)

**Restart** your PC and launch Aliens: Fireteam Elite to check whether the game crashes again. If not, you need to open the **System Configuration** window again to enable services and applications **one by one** until you find the problematic software.

 After enabling each service, you need to restart your PC to apply the changes.

 Once you find out the problematic software that crashes Aliens: Fireteam Elite, you need to **uninstall** it to avoid game crashing issues in the future.

 If the game still crashes after you disabled all the 3rd party apps and services, try reinstalling Aliens: Fireteam Elite. Normally, after reinstalling the game, you’ll be able to fix the crashing issue.
