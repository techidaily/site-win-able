## Try these fixes

 You may not have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. [Uninstall incompatible software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Reinstall the game](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Verify games files via Steam](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Update your graphics card driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Run as the administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Uninstall incompatible software

 Sometimes the third party software can interfere with your game. So uninstall the newly installed software to see whether it can help. If you have Razer Chroma SDK, Razer Synapse or Roccat Mouse driver installed on your PC, you’d better uninstall it and see whether it solves the Frostpunk crash issue.  
 Except for these drivers, your antivirus software may be the reason for the Frostpunk crash issue. So, disable your antivirus software and try downloading again to check if the issue persists.

 If this resolves your problem, you may need to replace your antivirus software or contact the vendor of the software for advice.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus software is disabled.

### Fix 2: Reinstall the game

 Fully uninstalling and reinstalling the game is an old easy but effective method. The game profile can be crashed which cause the Frostpunk crash. So doing a clean reinstall can fix the issue.

If it doesn’t work, you can move to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics card driver

 With outdated or wrong drivers, your game may encounter a crash. So it is very important to update your graphics card drivers. But Windows 10 doesn’t always give you the latest version automatically. Therefore, update your graphics card driver is always a good option.  
 There are two ways to update your drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-frostpunk-crash/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

But with the [Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):
