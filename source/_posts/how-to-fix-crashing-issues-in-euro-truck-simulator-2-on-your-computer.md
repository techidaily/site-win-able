 Here are Euro Truck Simulator 2’s**MINIMUM** system requirements:

| **OS:**         | Windows 7                             |

| **Processor** : | Dual core CPU 2.4 GHz                 |

| **Hard Drive:** | 3 GB available space                  |

 Make sure your PC meets the minimum system specs to run the game, then move on to the solutions below.

### Fix 1: Verify the integrity of game files

 Game crashing issues can be caused by a missing or corrupted game file. If you’re playing on Steam, follow the instructions below to verify the integrity of your game files:

### Fix 2: Check for mod errors

 If you’ve installed a mod and it’s no longer compatible with the current version of Euro Truck Simulator 2, then it could cause your game to crash.

 To see if that’s the issue for you, you can go to**C:\\Users\\Your user name\\documents\\euro truck simulator 2\\** and check the**game.log.txt file** for mod errors.

 If it turns out to be a mod issue, you’ll need to either update the mod or roll back your game to its previous version.

**5)** Restart your game to check if this worked for you.

If your game is still unplayable, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Update your graphics driver

 The graphics processing unit (GPU), or your graphics card, has the most impact on your gameplay experience. And your graphics driver is essential for getting top performance from your GPU.

 If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, it could result in game glitches and long rendering time. So try updating your graphics driver and then running the game again. There are 2 ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

**4)** After updating your graphics driver, try launching your game again to test your issue.

 If the crashing issue continues to occur, then go ahead with the fix below.

### Fix 5:**Run the game as an administrator**

 When you open a program, it won’t have full access to files and folders on your PC, which could cause trouble sometimes. So, you should grant your game administrator rights to see if it can function properly. Follow the instruction below:

**1)**  Right-click **Steam** and select **Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-27_14-35-03.jpg)

**2)** Click the **Compatibility tab** , then check the box next to **Run this program as an administrator** .

### Fix 6: Check for software conflicts

 If you’re running multiple programs during gameplay, it’s possible that one or more of your software is conflicting with your game. (Some users report that turning off**MSi Afterburner** helped in fixing the game crash, so if you have the program, turn it off while gaming.)

 So, you should turn off unnecessary applications while gaming. Follow the instructions below to see how to do it:

* **[If you’re on Windows 7…](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
