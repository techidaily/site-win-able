 Since many technical problems can be resolved by restarting, it never hurts to restart your computer and your game. Often this will be enough to fix your GTA 5 crashing issue.

### Fix 2: Avoid CPU overheating

 If your computer CPU is overheating, you’re likely to have the crashing issue in GTA 5, because your computer can’t work normally when being overheating, especially when it has to deal with the game running. So have a check on your computer and make sure it’s not overheating.

 If you’re CPU is overheating,**clean out your computer case** and guarantee a**proper ventilation** . You can shut down your computer for a while until it’s getting cool and able to process normally.

3. Restart your PC and GTA 5 again to see if it works.
