 Many people have reported that**Assassinâ€™s Creed Odyssey keeps crashing** on their PCs. Sometimes the**game crashes on startup** , or sometimes it**crashes randomly** without an error. If youâ€™re one of them, donâ€™t worry. You can fix Assassinâ€™s Creed Odyssey crashing issues.

## How to fix Assassinâ€™s Creed Odyssey crashing

 Here are the solutions to fix Assassinâ€™s Creed Odyssey crashing issue. You shouldnâ€™t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until everythingâ€™s working again.

1. **[Install the latest patch](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Stop overclocking your CPU](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update available drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Modify your in-game settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Verify Integrity of Game Files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

**Note** : Some Ubisoft games feature Denuvo DRM (digital rights management) which is an anti-tamper technology. In this case, it requires some kind of CPU feature to run the game. If your game doesnâ€™t have DRM removed, you may not be able to launch the game. And you should head to Ubisoft for suggestions.

### Fix 1: Install the latest patch

 Ubisoft (developer of Assassinâ€™s Creed) regularly releases patches to improve the game experience, as buggy issues in Assassinâ€™s Creed Odyssey can cause problems like crashing or lagging. So you should **check for the latest updates of your game, and install the available game patches** . This can help fix problems that are likely to cause the crashing.

 If this doesnâ€™t work for you, donâ€™t worry. There are other solutions to try.

### Fix 2: Stop overclocking your CPU

 Overclocking means setting your CPU and memory to run at speeds higher than their official speed rate, and almost all processors ship with a speed rating. However, this may cause your game to crash or freeze. In that case, you should**set your CPU clock speed rate back to the default** to fix your issue.

 Assassinâ€™s Creed Odyssey still crashes? Donâ€™t worry. Try the next solution.

### Fix 3: Update available drivers

 A missing or outdated device driver will cause Assassinâ€™s Creed Odyssey to crash, especially your video card driver and motherboard driver. To rule it out as the cause of your problem, you should update your device drivers to the latest version.

 There are two ways to update your drivers:**manually** and**automatically** .

* Manually update your drivers â€“ You should uninstall the faulty drivers in your computer first, then go to the manufacturerâ€™s website to search for the latest version of your driver, and install it on your computer. This takes time and computer skills.
* Automatically update your drivers â€“ If you donâ€™t have the time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee** ):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Then Driver Easy will scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
