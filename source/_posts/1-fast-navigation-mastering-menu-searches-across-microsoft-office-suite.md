## 1. Fast Navigation: Mastering Menu Searches Across Microsoft Office Suite

### Quick Links

* [Search the Menus in Microsoft Office](https://youtube-docs.techidaily.com/024-approved-how-to-create-a-youtube-channel-trailer-to-increase-revenue/)
* [Example Uses](https://extra-support.techidaily.com/secrets-to-preventing-photo-app-problems-in-windows-11-for-2024/)

### Key Takeaways

 Open the shortcut menu by right clicking an item, pressing the Menu key on a Windows keyboard, or using the Shift+F10 shortcut. Then, type the action or command you're looking for in the Search box at the top.

 While the Microsoft Office applications Word, Excel, and PowerPoint all have robust features, those features are not always easy to find. Stop scouring every menu, drop-down box, or dialog launcher on each tab and search the menus for what you need.

 For the Word, Excel, and PowerPoint [Office applications on Windows and the web](https://location-social.techidaily.com/in-2024-does-find-my-friends-work-on-vivo-s17e-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/), you can use a handy (and somewhat hidden) search tool. This feature, [introduced in the fall of 2022](https://insider.office.com/en-us/blog/quickly-find-the-command-you-need), flew a bit under the radar. We want to ensure you take advantage of this helpful way to find the commands you need.

 As of October 2022, the feature is available in Word, Excel, and PowerPoint on the web and to Office Insiders first for the desktop applications on Windows.

##  Example Uses

 If you work in [Word, Excel, and PowerPoint](https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/simplified-steps-for-photo-motion-blur-in-photoshop/) often, you probably use the same actions and commands regularly. But there's likely a time or two when you need something and aren't sure where to find it. Or, an action may require many steps. These are the perfect times to take advantage of the Search feature in the shortcut menu.
