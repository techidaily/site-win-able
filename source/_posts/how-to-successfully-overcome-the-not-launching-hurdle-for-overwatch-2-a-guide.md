## How to Successfully Fix Video Not Working on Zoom - Top 5 Tips

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/zoom-cannot-start-video-1.jpg)

 Zoom cannot start video or no camera is detected? You’re not alone. There have been quite a lot of reports about the camera issue on Zoom. In this post, we’ll show you the 5 best ways to fix your dysfunctional camera on Zoom, whether it’s not working, not detected or has poor quality.

## Try these fixes

 Here are 5 methods for you to troubleshoot the Zoom cannot start video error. You don’t have to try them all. Simply work from the top down until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Allow Zoom to access your camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Close other programs that use the camera](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Adjust the Zoom settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update your camera driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Reinstall Zoom](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 – Allow Zoom to access your camera

 A common cause that your camera isn’t working on an app is related to the permission settings. If you don’t allow the camera access for Zoom, it would stuck at a failed video. To enable the permission properly, follow the steps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open the Settings menu.
2. Select**Privacy** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-2-3.jpg)
3. Click **Camera** on the left pane. Then, click the **Change** button and turn on the Camera access for this device.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-3-3.jpg)
4. **Toggle on** the button under Allow apps to access your camera.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/1-4-1.jpg)

 Once applying the changes, you can relaunch Zoom and see if the camera is able to work correctly. If not, check out the next fix below.

### Fix 2 – Close other programs that use the camera

 When other programs are utilizing your camera, Zoom may lose control of your camera and therefore cannot start a video. To make sure there’s no interference with your webcam, try closing unncessary programs especially those telecommunication apps like Skype, WhatsApp, Discord or Microsoft Teams.

1. Right-click the empty space on your taskbar and click**Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1-1-10.jpg)
2. Right-click the application you want to shut down and click**End task** .

 Restart Zoom and test. If the error reoccurs, continue to the next solution.

### Fix 3 – Adjust the Zoom settings

 If you’ve constantly disconnected and reconnected your camera, the Zoom’s settings may be messed up. To ensure your camera is correctly selected, you should check the app settings. Here is how.

1. Launch your Zoom app.
2. Click the**gear icon** at the top right corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/2-6.jpg)
3. Select the**Video** tab. Then choose the correct camera from the drop-down menu.

 Check if the Zoom video issue is solved now. If not, there are two more fixes to try.

### Fix 4 – Update your camera driver

 If the camera driver on your PC is faulty or outdated, you may encounter the Zoom cannot start video issue. To keep your camera working at the best performance, you should update its driver to the latest.

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can update the driver manually. Just visit the website of your camera manufacturer, download the latest driver that’s right for your operating system, and install them manually.

 But if you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/de-borderless.jpg)
3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged webcam driver to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the**FREE version** ).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you‘ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).

### Fix 5 – Reinstall Zoom

 If you’ve walked through the process above but still can’t get the camera working, try reinstalling Zoom as the last resort. This should help you resolve some deeper program issues.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and R to invoke the Run box. Type in**appwiz.cpl** in the field and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-1.jpg)
2. Scroll to locate Zoom. Right-click it and click**Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/6-2.jpg)
3. After the app is completely uninstalled, you can go to **[Zoom’s official website](https://zoom.us/download)**  and download the latest client.
