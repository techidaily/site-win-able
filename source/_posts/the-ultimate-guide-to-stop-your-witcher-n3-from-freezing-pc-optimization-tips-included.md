 If this didn’t fix Zoom black screen issues for you, try the next fix below.

## Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 This issue could happen when your graphics driver is not compatible or gets corrupted somehow. So you want to make sure that your graphics driver is updated.

**You can manually** **check the driver for your graphics card** by going to the manufacturer’s website and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

 **If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .** Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

 You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![update graphics driver driver easy](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/de-1.jpg)

 3) Click the **Update button** next to the video driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it.

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

If you still have the problem, then try the next fix below.

## Fix 4: Turn on/off Hardware Acceleration

 When you run an application, it uses the standard CPU on your computer. If you run a heavy task, such as sharing your screen from Zoom, your app will use other hardware components on your PC to work more effectively.

 If you have good hardware, enabling Hardware Acceleration will result in better performance of your application; however, if your hardware is weak, this feature may cause problems for you.

 To see if this is the culprit for the black screen, try turning off/on Hardware Acceleration.

1) Open Zoom.

2) Go to Setting > Share screen > Advanced.

 3)**Uncheck** Enable hardware acceleration to optimize video sharing.

 Try screen sharing again with Zoom. If the black screen issue happens again, try the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 5: Exit full-screen mode

 If you’re running Zoom on the full-screen mode when the issue occurs, try exiting out of the full screen and then share your screen.

1) Open Zoom.

2) Go to Settings > General.

 3)**Uncheck** Enter full screen automatically when starting or joining a meeting.
