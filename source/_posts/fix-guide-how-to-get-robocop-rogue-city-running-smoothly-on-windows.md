## Preliminary steps: Check your PC specs

 The developer studio of Days Gone has released a guideline of requirements in order for the game to be played decently and smoothly. So if your copy of Days Gone fails to start often, it may be worth gauging whether your PC is up to the task.

 Below I have listed the minimum requirements and recommended requirements for Days Gone. If you are not sure how your PC is built, you can follow the later step to compare.

| **MINIMUM SPECIFICATIONS** | **RECOMMENDED SPECIFICATIONS**                            |                                                            |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OPERATING SYSTEM**       | Windows 10 64-bits                                        | Windows 10 64-bits                                         |

| **STORAGE**                | 70 GB available space                                     | 70 GB available space                                      |

2. Under the **System** tab and you can check the **Operating System**  and **Memory** information on your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/dxdiag-diagnostic-tool-1.png)

### Fix 1 – Install the latest game patch

 The developer team of Days Gone released a note of known bugs in the game. It is possible that the launching failure is also one of the bugs and that a patch is required to fix it. So you should keep a watchful eye on the latest patch. As long as it’s released, you should close the game, then restart Steam client or Epic Games Launcher for the updates to take effect.

 If you’ve installed the latest patch but the issue persists, please try**Fix 2** , below.

### Fix 2 – Update your graphics driver

 A graphics driver, acting as a translator between your operating system, programs and your graphics hardware, is essential to the proper functioning of the whole system. If the driver is wrong, outdated or corrupt, it may cause instabilities, crashing and game launching problems. So you should update your graphics driver to see if it solves the issue. If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with[](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Fix 3 – Launch Days Gone in Windowed Mode

### Fix 4 – Disable all overlays

 Overlay in Steam gives you access to features and apps without having to leave the game. However, some Steam players report that the feature has interfered with their gameplay and triggered the launching issues for them.

##### Disable Steam Overlay

1. Launch Steam and go to**LIBRARY** .
2. Locate Days Gone and right-click on**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/properties-1.png)
3. Uncheck the box for**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/uncheck.png)

##### Disable GeForce Experience Overlay

2. In the top right corner of the screen, click**Settings**  button.

##### Disable Discord Overlay

2. Click**the cog** icon in the lower left corner.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/discord.png)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/overlaydiscord.png)
4. Click**Esc** to exit the window.

</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Once you have disabled these overlays, run Days Gone and see if the launching problem is fixed. If not, move ahead to**Fix 5** .

### Fix 5 – Verify game integrity

 Days Gone may not launch if the game files are missing or corrupt. Luckily, both Steam client and Epic Game Launcher have built-in repair features, allowing you to verify the integrity of the game files and fix it (if anything wrong is found).

##### On Steam

1. Launch Steam and go to**LIBRARY** .
2. Locate Days Gone and right-click on**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/properties-1.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/local.png)
4. Wait a bit until the process finishes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/1of2.png)

 After that, re-launch the game and see if it opens without fail. If it’s still not launching, please continue with**Fix 6** , below.

##### On Epic Games Launcher

1. In Epic Game Launcher, click **Library** .
2. Locate Days Gone, then click **the three dots icon next to the game** and click **VERIFY** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/verify.png)
3. Wait a bit until the process finishes. After that, re-launch the game and see if it opens without fail. If it’s still not launching, please continue with**Fix 6** , below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

### Fix 6 – Rename the Movies Folder

 According to some players’ feedback, renaming the Movies folder has helped in recovering the game to normal. It may sound not too intuitive, but it’s worth a shot. To do so, simply find your game’s directory, locate the**Movies** folder, then rename the folder (e.g. Movies\_2).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/rename.png)

 Once finished, head back to your game launcher to fire the game up. If this cuts it, then great. If it’s yielding no result, just try**Fix 7** , below.

### Fix 7 – Close unnecessary apps

 Having too many apps running in the background may make your game fail to restart, since they compete for CPU and memory. So it makes sense that while you’re playing the game, you close these resources hungry applications and services.

Here’s how to close background apps:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo** **key** , then press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** keys at the same time to bring up Task Manager.
2. Select the**Startup** tab, then right-click on each item and click**Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/123.png)
3. Restart your computer.
