 As one of the most anticipated games of 2021, Amazon’s MMO New World is finally available now. However, many players have reported **experiencing lag spikes or losing connection issues while playing New World** . If you’re on the same boat and looking for solutions to this problem, this article is what you need.

 Don’t use a VPN or Proxy while playing, they can cause connectivity issues such as high latency.

## Try these fixes

 You might not need to try them all. Simply work your way down until you find the one that gives you luck.

1. **[Restart your modem and router](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Switch to a wired connection](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Verify integrity of game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Update your network driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Check for Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Close bandwidth-hogging applications](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
7. **[Troubleshoot your firewall and antivirus](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
8. **[Forward ports on your router](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Restart your modem and router

 When you experience lag or frequent disconnections while playing New World, one of the first things you should try is to restart your modem and router. This will allow your network devices to re-establish a fresh connection to your Internet Service Provider. Here’s how:

1. **Unplug** the modem and router from the power outlet.

2. **Wait** for 60 seconds.
3. **Plug** the modem and router back into the power outlet. Make sure the indicators are back to their normal state.

Once you’re back online, launch New World and check the gameplay.

If the lag issues persist, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Switch to a wired connection

 If you’re using a wireless connection while playing New World, you may encounter the lag issue due to wireless interference, weak wireless signal, etc. Switching to a wired connection can help you fix the potential problem and get a stable connection. **Simply connect your computer to your modem or router with a cable.** Besides, you can disable your computer’s wireless adapter to ensure it’s not being used. Here’s how:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together to open the Run dialog box. Then type**ncpa.cpl** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ncpa.cpl_.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window,**right-click your wireless adapter** and select**Disable** .

 _Note: You can enable your wireless network device by following the steps above, and then click**Enable** ._

### Fix 3: Verify integrity of game files

 If there are any missing or corrupted game files, you’re likely to experience many problems in-game, such as lag issues or frequent disconnections from the game. To fix it, you can verify the integrity of game files via Steam. Here’s how:

1. Go to your Steam**Library** .
2. **Right-click** New World and select**Properties…** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/steam-properties.jpg)

Once the process is complete, launch New World to test the gameplay.

### Fix 5: Check for Windows updates

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to open the Windows Settings. Then select**Update & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/updates-security.jpg)

<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4940317&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/333ac5d90817d69113471fbb6e531bee/sps-partnership-728x90eng.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/check-for-updates.jpg)

 Once you’ve installed all the updates, restart your computer and check if New World lags again.

If the lagging issue persists, try the next fix below.

### Fix 6: Close bandwidth-hogging applications

 The applications running in the background could take up a high amount of bandwidth and cause lag issues in your game. So make sure you’ve closed the bandwidth-hogging applications while playing New World. To do so:

1. On your keyboard, press**Ctrl** ,**Shift** and**Esc** at the same time to open the Task Manager.
2. Under the Processes tab, click**Network** to filter applications by their network usage, then**right-click** the bandwidth-hogging applications and select**End task** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/end-task.jpg)

 Once done, try launching New World again to see if the lag issue still occurs.

If this method doesn’t work for you, continue to the next fix.

### Fix 7: Troubleshoot your firewall and antivirus

 Sometimes your Windows Firewall and antivirus can prevent certain applications from working properly. To see if that’s the case, you can try temporarily disabling your firewall and antivirus or adding the game to the exclusions list.

**To add Windows firewall exceptions manually:**

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to invoke the Run dialog box. Type**firewall.cpl** and click**OK** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/firewall.cpl_.jpg)
2. In the pop-up window, click**Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/browse.jpg)

### Fix 8: Forward ports on your router

 If none of the fixes above helps you solve the lagging issue, you can try opening the necessary ports on your router to allow traffic between your network and game servers. This method has been proven useful for some players. So we suggest you give it a shot.

 Directions for forwarding ports are specific to the make and model of the router you’re using. If you don’t know how to do that, you can refer to the router’s manual or manufacturer’s website.

**Ports to forward for New World:**

TCP: 80, 443

UDP: 33435
