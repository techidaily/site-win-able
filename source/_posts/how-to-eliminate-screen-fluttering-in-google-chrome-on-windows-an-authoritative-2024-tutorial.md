| **Processor** | AMD Ryzen 5 1600 or Intel i5-4440 |
| **Memory**    | 8 GB RAM                          |
| **Graphics**  | AMD RX 570 or Nvidia GTX 1050 Ti  |
| **DirectX**   | Version 12                        |
| **Storage**   | 50 GB available space             |

 Halo Infinite supports indicates some minimum hardware specification GPUs may crash when playing intro cinematic sequences in 4k resolution.

You can fix it by uninstalling the multiplayer HD texture packs.

You can download the most recent correct driver from their websites ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  ) and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:
