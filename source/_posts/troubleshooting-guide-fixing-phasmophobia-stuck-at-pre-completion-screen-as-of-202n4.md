### Fix 1: Check your system specs

 If your game won’t launch at all, chances are that you’re running a game that stretches your PC beyond its abilities.

 You should verify that your system meets the minimum system requirements to run the game. If your PC below the recommended spec,   **try lowering your resolution and graphics and in-game video settings** .

 Here are the **minimum**  system requirements to play_Forza Horizon 4_ :

| **OS:**            | Windows 10 64-bit               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| **DirectX** :      | Version 12                      |
| **Memory** :       | 8GB RAM                         |
| **Processor:**     | Intel Core i3-4170 or higher    |
| **Graphics card:** | Nvidia GTX 650Ti or AMD R7 250X |
| **Storage** :      | 70GB available space            |

 Here are the**recommended** system requirements to run_Forza Horizon 4_ :

| **OS:**            | Windows 10 64-bit              |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| **DirectX:**       | Version 12                     |
| **Memory:**        | 12GB RAM                       |
| **Processor:**     | Intel Core i7-3820 or higher.  |
| **Graphics card:** | Nvidia GTX 970 or AMD R9 290X. |
| **Storage:**       | 70GB available space           |

 Make sure your PC is above the minimum system requirements to run the game, then move on and try the fix below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 One of the most common causes of the_Forza Horizon 4_ not launching problem is a faulty or outdated graphics driver. You should update your graphics driver to see if that’s the case for you.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
