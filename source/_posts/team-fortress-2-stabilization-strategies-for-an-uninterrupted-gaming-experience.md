Finally, Cyberpunk 2077 is released! But it could be very frustrating to encounter the freezing issue when you’re playing the game.

 Before trying these fixes, make sure your computer has met[the minimum requirements](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

## Try these fixes

 You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

5. **[Reinstall your game](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Perform a clean boot](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1: Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics card (GPU) is one of the most important components in gaming performance, especially for AAA games like Cyberpunk 2077\. If you’re using an outdated graphics driver, or the driver is corrupted, you’re likely to encounter game issues. So, make sure your graphics driver is updated.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for you.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 2: End unnecessary programs

 If you’re running multiple programs at the same time while gaming, that could cause your PC to overload and make your game freeze.

 Simply close all the unnecessary programs and run Cyberpunk 2077 again, check if it’s the cause of the freezing issue.

1. Right-click **your taskbar** and select **Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019-12-30_12-03-45.jpg)
2. Right-click the programs you want to close and select **End Task** . Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

### Fix 3: Verify your game files

1. Run Steam.
2. Click **LIBRARY** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-27_15-04-01.jpg)
3. Right-click **Cyberpunk 2077**  and select **Properties** .

5. Relaunch Cyberpunk 2077 to check the issue.

 If your game still won’t run correctly, then go ahead with the next fix, below.

### Fix 4: Adjust your virtual memory

**Virtual memory**  is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when running Cyberpunk 2077, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage.

 If you don’t have enough virtual memory to save temporary files, that can cause your game to freeze.

 If that’s the problem for you, increasing your virtual memory can fix it. Here is how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.** Then click **View advanced system settings** .
