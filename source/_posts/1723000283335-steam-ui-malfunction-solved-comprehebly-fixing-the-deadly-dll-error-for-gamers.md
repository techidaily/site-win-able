### Method 3: Reinstall Steam

 If you have this problem when you try to start Steam, you can reinstall Steam on your computer to try to solve the problem. In this case, Steam will reload a new steamui.dll file on your Windows computer.

 If you have the problem with other programs, then simply reinstall the exact program with the problem occurs.

### Method 4: Copy the steamui.dll file from a friends’s PC

 If unfortunately, all the previous methods fails to help, you can copy the steamui.dll file from a PC that runs the same Windows system as yours.

**Part 1:**   Check your Windows system type and find a computer that runs the same system with yours.

Here’s how you can check Windows type of a computer:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**   to bring up the Search box.
2. Type **system information**   and then select **System Information**   from the result.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc4618cc9a83.jpg)
3. You should then see the system type of the computer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc461cb24500.jpg)

**Part 2:**  Copy the steamui.dll file from the working computer and then paste it to the problem computer.

Here’s how you can find the dll file:

1. On the keyboard of the working computer, press the **Windows logo key**   and **E**   at the same time to bring up the File Explorer.
2. Go to **C:WindowsSystem32** , then type **steamui.dll**  and press **Enter** . If it shows no results, go to **C:WindowsSysWOW64**  instead and search **steamui.dll** again.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc561b04adb9.jpg)
3. Copy the steamui.dll file if found and paste it into the **same location**   as where you copy the file in your problem computer.

**Note:**   Keep in mid that not every computer with the same system type has the dll file you want to restore, so this method is not always successful either.

### Method 5: Fix your steamui.dll file by DLL?files.com Client

 You can also fix this problem automatically by **[DLL?files.com Client](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**  DLL?files.com Client will fix any DLL error in one click and restore your PC and programs to full working order.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install DLL.files.com Client on your computer.
2. Run Client. Then type**steamui.dll** and click**Search for DLL file** .

### PRO TIP: Update your device drivers

 An old, missing or corrupted driver might not cause this problem to occur, but it’ll cause problems to your video games, especially a wrong video driver. So we highly recommend **keeping your drivers up-to-date for the best gaming experience** .

 You can download the latest video driver from your video card’s manufacturer’s website, like AMD, NVIDIA.

Or

 If you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy. Then run it on your Windows.
2. Click **Scan Now** . It will quickly detect all drivers problems of your computer.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_59e02463e8b66.jpg)
3. C  lick **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
**Note** : You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.
