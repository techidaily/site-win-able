### Method 2: Run Fallout 76 as administrator

 The privilege issue might be the reason for this problem. With high integrity access, Fallout 76 can make full use of its features, so run the game as an administrator to see if this fixes your issue.

1. Exit Fallout 76.
2. Right-click on the Fallout 76 icon and click **Properties** .
3. Under the **Compatibility** tab, tick **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **OK** .

4. Run Fallout 76 and check whether the problem is solved or not.

### Method 3: Check your antivirus software

 Sometimes your antivirus software may be the reason for the Fallout 76 stuttering issue. So, disable your antivirus software and try downloading again to check if the issue persists.

 If this resolves your problem, you may need to replace your antivirus software or contact the vendor of the software for advice.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus software is disabled.
