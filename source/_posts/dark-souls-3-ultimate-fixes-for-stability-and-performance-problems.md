 You can go to the game options and change to Windowed mode, then re-launch your game to see if it works.

 If, unfortunately, you can’t access the game options, try modify the settings in the GraphicsConfig file.

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run box.

 2) Type**_%appdata%_** and press**Enter** .

 3) Open**DarkSouls3** folder.

 4) Open**GraphicsConfig.xml** with notepad. Then change  
**<config><ScreenMode>FULLSCREEN</ScreenMode>**
 to  
**<config><ScreenMode>WINDOWED</ScreenMode>**

 5) Save your change and restart your game.

 Your problem still persists, don’t worry. There are other solutions.

### Fix 3: Update your video driver

 Many players have reported that the graphics card driver may be the culprit to the crashing issue, and updating the graphics driver helps resolve the problem. So you should update your graphics card driver to the latest version.

 You can update your graphics card driver by navigating to graphics manufacturer website, find the latest version for your video card, then download and install it. This requires time and computer skills.

 If you don’t have the time or patience, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click_Update All_ ).

 Note: You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

4) Once your driver has been updated, restart your computer.

Now launch Dark Souls 3 and see if it works.

### Fix 4: Set game options to LOW

 If your game options are set High, this requires much more system resources and so Dark Souls 3 may crash. In that case, you should set game options to**_LOW_** so as to stop your game crashing.

 Be sure to set the resolution to the same resolution of your monitor. Also set**Effects quality** ,**Shadow quality** , and**Light quality** to**LOW** .

If you can’t access the in-game settings, try this:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** at the same time to open the Run box.

 2) Type**_%appdata%_** and press**Enter** .
