| ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| CPU               | Intel Core i7-975 \| AMD A 12-9800 APU |
| GPU               | GeForce GTS 450 \| Radeon R7 Graphics  |
| Storage           | 55 GB available                        |
| Screen resolution | 1920\*1080                             |

## Fix 1: Stop apps from running in the background

 1) On the left end of the taskbar, click the**Start** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Start-icon.jpg) icon and then click**Settings** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
  
 3) Scroll down and under the**App permissions** section, click**Background apps** .  
  
![Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/background-apps.jpg)

 4) You can stop all the apps from running in the background with just one click by switching**Let apps run in the background** to**Off** . But before you do this, make sure you’ve saved the files you’re currently editing.  
  
![stop apps from running in the background](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/switch-it-to-off-1.jpg)
  
 OR  
  
 Under the Choose which apps can run in the background section, manually select the ones you want to stop.

 After you free up disk space on your computer by disabling some apps from running in the background and still it doesn’t fix the problem of the game crashing, then don’t worry, there are a few other fixes you can try.

## Fix 3: Update your video card drivers

 A range of gaming problems such as crashing and freezing is caused by a wrong, faulty, or outdated graphics driver. Halo 3 is no exception. To enjoy smooth gameplay, you should always keep your graphics driver up to date.

 You can search for the latest graphics driver from your graphics card’s manufacturer [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) or [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , and then manually install it. But if you don’t have the time, patience, or skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

Here’s how to update your drivers with Driver Easy:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![update drivers automatically](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/scan-now-driver-easy-1.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/update-all-NVIDIA-RTX-2080.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support. If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 After updating your drivers, restart your computer and launch Halo3 to check if the issue is fixed. If not, try the next fix.

## Fix 4: Perform a clean boot

 1) Press the**Windows logo key** and**R** together on your keyboard to open the Run box.

7) Restart your computer and it’ll be in a clean boot environment.

## Fix 5: Run Halo 3 as an administrator

 1) Right-click the**Halo 3** icon on your desktop and select**Properties** .  
  
![open as an administrator; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/run-as-administrator-Properties.jpg)

 3) Go to the directory where you installed Halo 3, and run the**.exe** file as administrator as well.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 6: Install the latest game patch

 When a new game is released, there are still many bugs in it. And those bugs might cause the game crash issues. So developers keep updating the games to fix the bugs and improve the gaming performance.  
  
 So if there is a patch available, download and install it, then run the game again to check if the problem is solved. If it isn’t, or there is no new patch available, then move on to Fix 7.

---

## Fix 7: Verify the integrity of game files

 Halo 3 is available on PC through Steam. But players have been experiencing sudden crashes in Halo 3 on Steam. It can be caused by a bad game cache, so you need to ensure that the integrity of game files is intact.  
  
 1) Run Steam  
  
 2) Click the**LIBRARY** tab.  
  
![verify integrity of game files on Steam; Halo 3 game crash](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/verify-integrity-of-game-files.jpg)
