![check for updates](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/update-to-new-version-battle.net_.jpg)

 If you already have the latest version of Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War but the error code just shows up again, try the next fix, below.

## 3\. Update the graphics driver

 If this error code 80070057 persists after you tried “Scan and Repair” and “Check for Updates”, it is mainly related to the video file, which can be caused by an outdated/corrupt driver or driver incompatibility.

 A missing or outdated graphics driver can cause the**Error Code 80070057** in COD: Black Ops Cold War, so you should update your graphics card driver (and sometimes your sound card driver, too) to get rid of this error message.

 You can manually update the graphics driver by downloading the latest driver from the manufacturer’s website such as[NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) and install it manually. If you don’t have time, patience, or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Scan-now-1.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to the flagged video card to automatically download the correct version of their driver (you can do this with the **FREE** version), and then install it manually on your computer.  
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://bluettieu.pxf.io/c/5597632/2042323/17091" target="_top" id="2042323"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17091-2042323" border="0" alt="BLUETTI NEW LAUNCH AC180T" width="3840" height="1600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/2042323/17091" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/update-driver-now.jpg)  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll get full tech support and a 30-day money-back guarantee).
4. Restart your computer and launch your game to test the issue.

 Usually, this will fix your Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War error code 80070057\. But if this error code persists, don’t worry. There’re a few more fixes to try.

## 4\. Run your game in DX11

 If you still get this error in some specific spots, but all of your device drivers are up-to-date, the culprit might be DirectX 12\. There are some problems with advanced DX12 features such as ray tracing and variable rate shading. To enjoy a crash-free game, you can run your game in DX 11 instead. Here’s how:

1. Open the**Battle.net** app and locate your**Call of Duty: BOCW** under the**GAMES** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/COD.jpg)
2. Select**Game Settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/game-settings.jpg)
3. Under**Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War** , check the box next to**Additional command line arguments** . Then type**\-d3d11** into the box to force the game to run in DX11.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Game-settings-DX11.jpg)
4. Click**Done** to apply the changes.

 Launch the game and play for a while to see if the error code 80070057 persists. If your game is working like a charm now, then congratulations. But if not, try the fix, below.

## 5\. Delete the Battle.net Cache folder

 Your cache folder might get corrupted and it might cause some game issues such as the error code 80070057\. To fix this error code, you can try deleting the Cache folder (this won’t affect your game data) to resolve issues caused by outdated files.

1. Press**Ctrl** +**Shift** +**Delete** to open Task Manager, and close any Blizzard programs(highlight every process and select**End Task** ).
2. Press**Windows** Key+**R** to open the Run dialogue. Type**%ProgramData%** into the Run field and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/data.jpg)
3. Delete the folder**Blizzard Entertainment** , which contains the cache directory.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/delete-cache.jpg)
4. Restart the Battle.net app and relaunch the game.

## 6\. Set English as the Windows display language

 Many players fixed the error code by setting English as the display language when playing Black Ops Cold War.

1. In the Windows Search bar, start typing**language** and select**Language settings** from the results list.
