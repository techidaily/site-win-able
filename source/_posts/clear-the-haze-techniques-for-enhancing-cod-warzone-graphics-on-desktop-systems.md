### Fix 1: Meet the minimum system requirements

 The minimum system specifications to play_DOOM_ need to be met to run the game. Here are the system requirements to play_DOOM_ :

| **DOOM Minimum Specifications** | **DOOM Recommended Specifications**                 |                                            |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **OS:**                         | Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit versions)                  | Windows 7/8.1/10 (64-bit versions)         |
| **Processor:**                  | Intel Core i5-2400/AMD FX-8320 or better            | Intel Core i7-3770 / AMD FX-8350           |
| **Memory:**                     | 8 GB RAM                                            | 8 GB RAM                                   |
| **Graphics:**                   | NVIDIA GTX 670 2GB/AMD Radeon HD 7870 2GB or better | NVIDIA GTX 970 4GB / AMD Radeon R9 290 4GB |
| **Storage:**                    | 55 GB available space                               | 55 GB available space                      |

 Make sure that your computer meets DOOM’s**MINIMUM** specifications, then go ahead with the fix below.

 If your computer didn’t meet the**MINIMUM** requirements, the only solution would be an upgrade to your computer’s hardware.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 If you haven’t updated your graphics driver for a long time, chances are that an outdated or corrupted graphics driver is causing the crashing issue for you. Try updating your graphics driver to see if it resolves your issue. There are two ways you can do this:

* **[Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[Option 2 – Automatically update the driver (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/doom-crash-issues-2019-tips/#c2)**

#### **Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**

 The manufacturer of your graphics product keeps updating drivers. To get the latest graphics driver, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### **Option 2 – Automatically update the drivers**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-113-1.jpg)

**3)** Click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

### Fix 3: Verify the integrity of your game files

**1)** Run Steam client.

**2)** Click **LIBRARY.**

### Fix 4: Lower your in-game settings

 Improper game settings can also cause the game to fail. If the game isn’t running smoothly, try lowing the graphics settings. Here is how:

**1)** Run**DOOM** .

**2)** Go to**SETTINGS > VIDEO >Advanced Settings** .

**3)** Find the**Virtual Texture Pool Size** , and turn it to**Low** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/2020-04-01_17-36-42.jpg)

**4)** Relaunch the game to see if this worked.

If not, move on and try the next solution below.

### Fix 5: Increase virtual memory

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when performing an intensive task, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage.

 If the virtual memory is not sufficient, applications running on your PC might fail. Follow the instructions below to increase the size of your virtual memory:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-884.png)

**2)** Click **View advanced system settings.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-882.png)

**3)** Click **Settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-881.png)

**4)**  Click the **Advanced**  tab, and then click **Change** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-880.png)

**5)** Uncheck the box next to **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/paging-file.png)

**6)** Click your **C drive** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/image-879.png)

**7)** Click the option button next to **Custom size** , and then type **4096** in the text box next to **Initial size (MB)**  and **Maximum size (MB)** .

* **Initial size** – This value varies, depending on your computer. If you’re not sure what value to use, just enter whatever the number is in the **Recommended** category.
* **Maximum size** – Don’t set this value too high. It should be about 1.5 times the size of your physical RAM. e.g. A PC with 4 GB (4096 MB) of RAM should have no more than about 6,144 MB virtual memory (4096 MB x 1.5).
