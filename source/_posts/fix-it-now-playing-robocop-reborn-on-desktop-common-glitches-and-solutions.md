## Try these fixes

 You don’t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Reboot your network](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Allow Hitman 3 to run through Windows Firewall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Update your network driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Run your game as an administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Disable antivirus software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
6. **[Flush your DNS and Renew your IP](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## Fix 1: Reboot your network

 Before you try any of the fixes below, you may want to simply restart your game and router. If restarting the game multiple times failed to launch the game, you’ll need to restart your network:

1. **Turn off everything** that is connected to the network.
2. Unplug your**router first** and your**modem second** . Things could be much easier if you have a[router with a built-in modem](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Nighthawk-C7000-Compatible-Providers-including/dp/B0781Z5PCL/?tag=drivereasycom-20) .
3. Wait**at least 10 seconds** .
4. Plug your**modem back in first** and your**router second** .
5. Grab yourself a cup of coffee, for this may take 2 to 3 minutes for your modem and router to fully boot up.
6. Turn on your computer and connect to the Internet.
7. Launch your game again and see if Hitman 3 works properly now.

## Fix 2: Allow Hitman 3 to run through Windows Firewall

 The**Connection Failed** error can happen if Windows Firewall is blocking your game. So be sure to check the Windows Firewall settings and let your Hitman 3 run through Windows Firewall. Here is how:

1. In the Windows Search bar, type**firewall** and select**Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![Windows defender firewall](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Windows-firewall.jpg)
2. On the left pane, click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/allow-app.jpg)
3. Make sure your Hitman 3 is on the list, and also make sure it’s ticked for**Private** .

4. If you don’t find Hitman 3, click**Change settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/change-settings.jpg)
5. Click**Allow another app…**  

![change settings](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/allow-another-app.jpg)
6. Add your Hitman 3 executable file. If you’re not sure where the game is installed, please follow these steps:  

   * Click on the game title in your library.  
   * Select _**Properties**_ from the menu on the left.  
   * In the _**Local files**_ section, press _**Open folder**_ .  
   ![open hitman 3 folder](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Open-folders.png)
7. Now launch your game again and test if the**Hitman 3 connection failed error** has been solved.

## Fix 4: Run your game as an administrator

 This might be triggered by limited administrative rights. So to make sure you can access all the game files, you can run Hitman 3 and Epic Games Launcher as administrators. Here’s how to run it as admin permanently:

1. Right-click your Hitman 3 executable file (and game launcher), and select**Properties** .
2. Select the tab **Compatibility** and check the box next to **Run this program as an administrator** . Then click **Apply > OK** .  
![run as admin](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/run-as-admin.jpg)
3. Next time you open your game launcher, it will launch in admin mode.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

## Fix 5: Disable antivirus software

 Some antivirus software may block some features in Hitman 3 so that you can encounter the “**connection failed** ” error. If you have installed antivirus software on your computer, you can disable it temporarily and check to see if the problem is resolved.

 For some antivirus software, disabling them might not work. You can temporally uninstall it or add Hitman 3 to their exclusion lists.

**Note:** Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open, and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows Logo Key** and **R** at the same time to open the Run dialog.
