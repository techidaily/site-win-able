### Fix 1: Check if your PC meets the system requirements for DayZ

 DayZ crashing issue often occurs when the specs of your PC fails to meet the system requirements for DayZ. Before trying other fixes, you should make sure your PC meet the minimum system requirements for the game.

Below are the minimum and recommended system requirements for DayZ:

#### The minimum system requirements for DayZ

| **OS:**         | Windows 7/8.1 64-bit                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Processor:**  | Intel Core i5-4430                    |
| **Memory:**     | 8 GB RAM                              |
| **Graphics:**   | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or AMD R9 270X |
| **DirectX:**    | Version 11                            |
| **Storage:**    | 16 GB available space                 |
| **Sound Card:** | DirectX®-compatible                   |
| **Network:**    | Internet connection                   |

#### The recommended system requirements for DayZ

| **OS:**         | Windows 10 64-bit                     |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Processor:**  | Intel Core i5-6600K or AMD R5 1600X   |
| **Memory:**     | 12 GB RAM                             |
| **Graphics:**   | NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or AMD RX 580 |
| **DirectX:**    | Version 11                            |
| **Storage:**    | 25 GB available space                 |
| **Sound Card:** | DirectX®-compatible                   |
| **Network:**    | Internet connection                   |

 If your PC fails to meet DayZ minimum system requirements, you may not be able to run the game properly on your PC. In such a case, you need to **upgrade your hardware first** . If you don’t know how to check the DirectX version on your PC, you can refer to the first step in the post: [ Download DirectX 12 for Windows 10 \[SOLVED\]](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 6: Add DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application

 This issue may also be triggered by your third-party antivirus application. Since the third-party antivirus application hooks very deep into your system, it may interfere with DayZ.

 Since DayZ consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when you’re playing a game, many third-party antivirus application may regard it as a potential threat. You can try   **adding DayZ as an exception to your third-party antivirus application** .

 Please consult your antivirus documentation for instructions if you don’t know how to do it.

 See if you can run DayZ without crashes. If not, try the next fix below to reinstall the game.

### Fix 7: Reinstall DayZ

 If none of the fixes works, you may need to reinstall DayZ to fix this issue. To reinstall DayZ:

1. Open Steam and go to **LIBRARY** .
2. **Right-click** DayZ and select **Delete Local Content…** . to uninstall the game.
3. When the uninstalling process completes, click the game name within your Library to reinstall the game.
