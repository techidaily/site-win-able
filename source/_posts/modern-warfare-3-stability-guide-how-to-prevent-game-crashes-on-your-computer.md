## Try these fixes

2. [Run as administrator](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Verify game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Edit username

 It may sound ridiculous, but some players have reported that their usernames are solely composed of characters in your platform’s text language can fix the NieR Replicant crash at startup.

 That means, if your platform language is English, you can’t use not-standard-English characters in your username. After removing these marks or characters, the problem is solved.

### Fix 2: Run as administrator

If this fix doesn’t bring luck, take a look at the next one below.

### Fix 4: Update your drivers

 One of the most common causes of games crashing is you’re using outdated or corrupted drivers. You need to make sure your drivers are fully up-to-date so that you’re able to enjoy one of the best AAA titles in 2021.

There are mainly two ways you can update the graphics driver:

**Option 1 – Manually** – Graphics card manufacturers will roll out graphics drivers optimized for the latest titles on a regular basis. You can download the most recent correct driver from their websites ( **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  ) and install it manually.

**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![update graphics driver for hitman 3](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/update-graphics-driver-de-1.jpg)
3. Click the **Update** button next to the flagged graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click **Update All** .)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Restart your PC after drivers are updated, then relaunch the game to check.

 If the latest drivers doesn’t solve the issue, move to the next fix.

### Fix 5: Disable your antivirus software

 It’s possible that your anti-virus/Windows Security is interfering with NieR Replicant. When they block part of game files, there’ll be crashes. Therefore, disable real-time protection temporarily or make an exception for the game in the antivirus software would fix the issue.

Here’s how to disable Windows Security temporarily.
