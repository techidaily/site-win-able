## 2024'S Top Tricks for a Smooth Dota 2 Experience: Stop Lag Once and For Good

Delays and lags in-game are no doubt ruining the fun of the game. If that’s a problem for you when you’re playing Dota 2 and you want to fix Dota 2 lag during gameplay, you’re in the right place.

## Try these fixes

 There’re 2 types of lag relevant to gaming – one is FPS lag, the other is network lag. If you’re experience the FPS lag, usually you can adjust your graphics settings to fix it. If you’re experiencing network lag instead – your network connection has slowed down, you can check for bandwidth-hungry apps and your network settings.

 Here’re some know fixes for the Dota 2 lagging issue. You may not have to try them all. Just work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
