If not, then you can try the next fix below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The graphics card is no doubt one of the most important hardware for gaming. So **if your graphics driver is outdated or faulty, you might experience a black screen while playing Rainbow Six Siege** . Besides, the manufacturers of graphics cards frequently release new drivers, which usually can improve the performance of new games. If you don’t remember the last time you updated your graphics driver, then now is a great time to have it done.

Here are two ways you can try to update your graphics driver:

#### Option 1 — Manually

 You can go to the official website ( **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  , **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[Intel](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  ) of your graphics card to download and install the latest version of the driver. This needs some time, patience and computer skills.

#### **Option 2 — Automatically (Recommended)**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your device drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system, find the correct drivers for your exact devices and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/scannow-1.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).  
 Or you can click Update next to the flagged device driver to do it for free, but it’s partly manual.

 Once you’ve updated your graphics driver, launch Rainbow Six Siege and see if the issue persists.

If the black screen issue still remains, you can try the next fix.

### Fix 3: Install the latest Windows updates

 If you’re on Windows 10, you might fix the black screen error by installing the latest Windows updates. That’s because every Windows update will fix mostly all the latest bugs. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** key at the same time to open**Settings** .
2. Click**Updates & Security** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/update-security.jpg)
3. Under Windows Update, click**Check for updates** . The system will automatically start the search for new Windows updates if available. If there is any, it will download the update directly.

4. Once the update is completed, restart your computer to apply changes.

 Now you can launch Rainbow Six Siege again to see if the black screen problem persists or not.

If the problem still remains, you can try the following fixes.

### Fix 4: Check the advanced power options

 Your power settings might affect your GPU’s performance based on power saving options. To make sure your graphics card is properly powered, you can check the advanced power settings. Here’s how to do it:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**R** key together to open the Run dialog box. Then type in**control panel** and click**OK** .
