## Expert Advice: Overcoming Error 0XC19001E1 on Your Windows 11 Machine - Quick Fixes

Trying to update your PC to 20H2 but Windows failed to install the updates? It’s really annoying to have updates stuck at 61% forever. Don’t worry, you’re not alone and this post is going to help.

## Try these fixes

1. [Remove periphery devices](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Update your drivers (100% working for HP users)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fixed-error-0xc19001e1-in-windows-10/#f2)
3. [Disable antivirus](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Use Windows troubleshooter](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Repair system files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. [Free up disk space](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
7. [Reset or reinstall Windows](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Remove periphery devices

 This should be the first thing to do when problems occur. This is the easiest way to check whether external devices conflict with Windows Updating Process. By removing all periphery hardware components except for the mouse and keyboard, we’ll know whether it’s a hardware issue.

 If this does sort out the issue, try plugging back each device one by one. In this way, you can recognize which device causes the problem.

 If it’s not sorting out the issue, let’s head to the next fix.

### Fix 2: Update your drivers

 If you’re an HP user, you need to update your Conexant drivers. But the newer version can’t be found on the HP drivers page neither in Device Manager. So follow the steps below and you can update to 20H2 successfully.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.**Driver Easy** will automatically recognize your system and find the correct and the latest drivers for it.
2. Run[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

### Fix 3: Disable antivirus

 The third-party antivirus software is installed to protect our PC from malware attacks, but sometimes they could be the culprit for PC errors.

 During the Windows updating process, the third-party antivirus could interfere and block the new files which can cause the Windows Update error code 0xc19001e1.

 Therefore, disable the antivirus software then restart your PC to apply the change. Update your Windows system and see if it fixes the issue.

Don’t forget to enable the software afterward.

If the error persists, move to the next fix.

### Fix 5: Repair system files

 One of the reasons that cause the Windows Update Error 0xc19001e1 is corrupted system files.

Here’s how to fix it:

* [Option 1- Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fixed-error-0xc19001e1-in-windows-10/#reimage)  
 Use a repair tool to check various areas in your computer to determine the cause of Windows common issues. It will deal with issues related to system errors, and critical system files and find the right fix for you.
* Option 2 – Manually  
 System File Checker is a built-in tool to check for corrupt, damaged system files and manage to restore them if there are any. However, this tool can only diagnose major system files, and won’t deal with damaged DLL, Windows Registry key, etc.

#### Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)

**[Fortect](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a computer repair software that can diagnose problems on your computer and fix them immediately.

 It is tailored to your specific system and is working in a private and automatic way. It will first check hardware-related issues to identify problems, and then security issues, and finally it detects programs that crash, and missing system files. Once complete, it will find a solution to your specific problem.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-1.jpg)
3. Fortect will scan your computer thoroughly. This may take a few minutes.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-2.jpg)
4. Once done, you’ll see a detailed report of all the issues on your PC. To fix them automatically, click**Start Repair** . This requires you to purchase the full version. But don’t worry. If Fortect doesn’t solve the issue, you can request a refund within 60 days.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/fortect-3.jpg)

 The Pro version of Fortect comes with 24/7 technical support. If you need any assistance, please contact Fortect support:  
 Email: **<support@fortect.com>**

#### Option 2 – Manually

 This command line will scan all the Windows files and repair the broken ones. Here’s how to run it:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** key at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**cmd** and press **Shift** +**Ctrl** +**Enter** together on your keyboard to open Command Prompt in the administrator mode.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Snap825.jpg)  
**Note** : Do **NOT** click OK or just press the Enter key as that won’t allow you to open Command Prompt in the administrator mode.
3. Type**sfc /scannow** (or copy-paste) and press **Enter** . Then wait for the verification is 100% complete.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Snap4.jpg)
4. Restart your computer to check the blue screen issue is fixed or not.

 If the result indicates there are broken files but SFC can’t fix them, you can turn to[Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) Tool](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) for deeper examination and repair.

### Fix 6: Free up disk space

 When there’s no enough space on your disc for the installation of the update, you might receive error code 0xc19001e1\. So you need to ensure you have enough space. If you don’t have, deleting junk and duplicate files to free up some space.

1. Press**Windows logo key + I** together on your keyboard. Then click**System** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/click-on-System.jpg)
2. Click**Storage** on the left panel and you can view the storage usage of your computer.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 This should free up an amount of space for you. But if that isn’t enough for you, then you should check if there are other files or programs you may want to remove:

1. Click the**left arrow** in the upper left corner of the window to go back to the storage settings.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c3f0094a368f.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
3. Check the space usage of_each data type_ . If you want to manage the usage of a type,**click it** to view more details.  
\* The following are a few things we recommend you take a look at:  
   * **The data type that uses the most amount of space**  
   * **Apps & Games** to see if there are any program installed you don’t need  
   * **Temporary files**  
   * **Desktop**  
   * …  
   ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/img_5c3f07dd26e5a.jpg)

 This should free up a lot of space for your Windows 10 computer. Reboot your PC and update your system.
