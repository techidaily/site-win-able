### Fix 1 – Restart your computer

 A refresh restart will reset the software and desktop environment and can often fix software glitches like this.

 So if you haven’t done this yet, give it a shot. A simple restart may be all you need to solve Roblox or Roblox Studio-related issues.

### Fix 2 – Try an alternative browser

 Roblox is compatible with all leading browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, and more. To make sure Roblox works well on your device, make sure you’re using the latest version of the browser.

 If you’re still unable to get into a Roblox game from your current browser, try a different one to see if it works. For example, if you can’t launch your Roblox game from Chrome, try opening Firefox and launch the game.

 If Roblox won’t load the game from any browser, read on and try the next fix.

### Fix 3 – Reset your Internet Options

 In some cases, you can fix Roblox loading issues by resetting your PC’s Internet Options.

 You’ll need to open Internet Explorer to perform the following steps, but this will fix problems even if you use other browsers, such as Chrome, to play the game.

**1)**  Run **Internet Explorer** .

**2)** Click the **gear button** on the top-right corner of your screen, then click **Internet options** .

**3)** Click the **Advanced tab** , and then click **Reset** .

**4)**  Click **Reset** .

### Fix 4 – Disable your ad-blocker/extensions

 Browser extensions, especially ad-blockers that modify page content could also interfere with Roblox. So if you’re running any browser extensions, you may also want to try disabling them.

 This process varies slightly in different browsers. If you’re using Chrome, follow the instructions below:

**1)**  Open Chrome.

**2)** Click the **Menu** button.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-288.png)

**3)**  Select **More tools** , and then select **Extensions** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-289.png)

**4)**  Click the **toggle**  to disable your extensions one by one, try relaunching your Roblox game each time to check if your problem is caused by any of these extensions.

 If your game still won’t load correctly, don’t fret. Try the next fix.

### Fix 5 – Check your Firewall

 As with all multiplayer games, Roblox requires an internet connection to send and receive data.

 If Roblox is having issues loading games, there’s a good chance your Firewall is restricting Roblox’s access to the internet. Follow the instructions below to see how to check if Roblox is allowed through your Windows Defender’s firewall:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**  and **R** at the same time.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-06_12-00-40-1.jpg)

**2)**  Type **control**  and then press the **Enter key** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_17-12-04-3.jpg)

**3)** Under **View by** , select **Small icons** , then click **Windows Defender Firewall** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/roblox-firewall-3.jpg)

**9)**  Firewall will prompt you to allow access to networks, click **Allow access** .

If you still can’t join the game, move on to the next fix.

### Fix 6 – Temporarily close your anti-virus

 Your problem is sometimes caused by interference from antivirus software. To see if that’s the problem for you, temporarily disable your antivirus program and firewall and check if the problem persists. (Consult your antivirus documentation for instructions on disabling it.)

 If Chrome works properly after you disable the antivirus software, contact the vendor of your antivirus software and ask them for advice, or install a different antivirus solution.

 Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open, and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

### Fix 7 – Clear your browser cookies and cache

 The cache and cookies stored by your browser, if corrupted, can sometimes cause issues. Try clearing your browser cookies and cacher to see if this helped:

**1)** Open your browser.

**2)**  On your keyboard, press the **Ctrl, Shift,**  and **Del**  keys at the same time. Then, click **Clear data** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/image-283.png)

**3)**  Relaunch your browser and your Roblox game.

If the game is still not opening up, try the next below.

### Fix 8 – Reinstall Roblox and Roblox Studio

 If you’re still having issues running Roblox games, try reinstalling Roblox and Roblox Studio too. This will overwrite and replace any deleted or broken files and fix any related issues.

Follow the instructions below:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R** at the same time to invoke the Run box.

**2)** Type **appwiz.cpl** and click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/unstall-roblox-1-.jpg)

**3)** Right-click the Roblox app and click **Uninstall** . If you see**Roblox Stuido** , uninstall it, too.

### Fix 9 – Update your device driver

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
