<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Fix 3: Reinstall your drivers

 Outdated or wrong drivers could cause trouble. When you meet computer problems but have no clue to fix them, you can update related drivers for a try. Keeping your drivers updated can help you enhance device functions to improve computer performance.

 There are two ways you can update your drivers: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 – Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/solved-logitech-c920-webcam-not-working/#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 You can download graphics drivers from the manufacturer’s official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

## Fix 4: Disable conflict apps

 There’s a situation where your webcam stops working because of other programs. The conflict apps could be Skype, Discord, VPN, or others. According to our readers,**VPN provided by Malwarebytes** is one of the conflicting apps.  
 To fix the problem, simply switch the conflicting app off, or disable it through Task Manager.

1. Press the**Ctrl + Shift + Esc** keys together to open the**Task Manager** .
2. Find the conflicting app and click**End task** .

3. Reboot your camera to check.

## Fix 5: Repair system files

 Sometimes corrupted system files and hardware issues will lead to all kinds of errors. To identify the cause and repair it, you don’t have to check those components one by one but perform a quick automatic system scan.

 You can use[**Fortect**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to run an automatic system scan and repair systems with one-click. It is a powerful tool that specializes in Windows repair and cleaning to get your PC optimized. It scans to get full visibility of your PC health so that it can repair and replace damaged or missing files on your computer (registry keys, DLL files, etc). It’s like a fresh reinstallation of Windows, but keep your programs, user data, and settings as they are.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Open Fortect and click**Yes** to run a free scan of your PC.
