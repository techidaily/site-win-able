### Fix 2: Update your video driver

 An old, corrupted or missing video driver on your system could also cause Fallout 4 to stutter. When you’re encountering Fallout 4 stuttering, we recommend**updating your video driver** for the best gaming experience.

You can update your video driver either manually or automatically.

#### Manual video driver update

 You can update your video driver manually by going to the**manufacturer’s website** for your graphics card, like**NVIDIA** and**AMD** , and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

####

#### Automatic video driver update

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact graphics card, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b95d9711631c.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with**full support** and a**30-day money back** guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)  

 Note: You can do it**for free** if you like, but it’s partly manual.![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b95da089dde0.jpg)

### Fix 3: Change the resolutions back to your monitor size

 You probably run Fallout 4 in the borderless mode, it’s great. But there’s one thing you should check after setting the borderless mode — change the resolutions back to your monitor size:

#### Step 1: Check the recommended resolutions of your monitor

 On your desktop, right-click on the blank area to select**Display Settings** (Windows 10) /**Screen Resolutions** (Windows 7). Then check the resolutions with the**Recommended** character. (You will need to set this same resolution in Fallout 4). Generally, this is your monitor size.  
  
 Usually your system is set to the recommend resolution, if it’s not, set it to be.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/img_5b95db0636cd2.jpg)

#### Step 2: Change the resolutions in Fallout 4 back to your monitor size

1. Launch Fallout 4 on your computer.
2. On the launcher menu, click**Options** .
3. Make sure the Resolutions is set to same as your monitor size, that is, the**recommended one** you check in Step 1.

### Fix 4: Change your game mode and correct the resolutions by modifying your game file

 If the Fix 3 fails to help, you can try this method to change your game mode and correct the resolutions by modifying your game file.

Here’s how you can do it:

1. Go to the location of your Fallout 4 game documents. Basically, it locates in:  

**C:Users\\YourWindowsName\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout4**
2. Right-click**Fallout4Prefs.ini** to select**Open with** \>**Notepad** . Then find the following lines and change them as shown below. You can quickly find the lines by pressing the Ctrl and F keys together and entering the texts to search.  
**Important: iSize H** &**iSize W** here should be set to**the same as your monitor size** . If you’re not sure about this, check if by the[Step 1](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) in the last fix.  
**bMaximizeWindow=1**  
**bBorderless=1**  
**bFull Screen=0**  
**iSize H=1080**  
**iSize W=1920**
3. Save the file and exit Notepad.

Run Fallout 4 to see if it goes smoothly.

---

### Fix 5: Adjust the frame rate

**Frame rate** refers to the number of individual images that are displayed per second in your game display. If the frame rate of Fallout 4 on your system drops, everything will**slow down** .**58 fps** is the recommended frame rate you can set. Why 58? It’s some kind of magic number as the least problems happen at this frame rate.

Here’s how you can set the frame rate of Fallout 4:

1. Go to the location of your Fallout 4 game documents. Basically, it locates in:  

**C:\\Users\\YourWindowsName\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout4**
2. Right-click**Fallout4Prefs.ini** to select**Open with** \>**Notepad** . Then find**iFPSClamp** and set it to**58** : (You can quickly find iFPSClamp by pressing the Ctrl and F keys together and enter iFPSClamp to search.)  

**iFPSClamp=58**
3. Save the file and exit Notepad.

Run Fallout 4 to see if it goes smoothly.

### Fix 6: Disable the V-sync feature

**V-sync** (vertical sync) is the synchronization of your frame rate with the maximum refresh rat of the display being used. So being enabled, V-sync would**limits the frame rate** of your game. If the frame rates is low, everything displaying on Fallout 4 will slowdown. In this case, we recommend disabling the V-sync feature.

Here’s how to do it:

1. Go to the location of your Fallout 4 game documents. Basically, it locates in:  

 **C:\\Users\\YourWindowsName\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout4**
2. Right-click**Fallout4Prefs.ini** to select**Open with** \>**Notepad** . Then find**iPresentInterval** and set it to**0** : (You can quickly find **iPresentInterval**  by pressing the Ctrl and F keys together and enter**iPresentInterval**  to search.)  

 **iPresentInterval=0**
3. Save the file and exit Notepad.

Run Fallout 4 to see if it goes smoothly.
