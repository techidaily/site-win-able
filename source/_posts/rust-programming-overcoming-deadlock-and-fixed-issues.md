### Fix 1: Install all Windows updates

**The latest Windows updates** give you bug fixes and some boost of overall performance. Usually Windows updates automatically, but it’s best for you to make sure your system is up to date.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key) to open the Windows Settings app. Click**Update & Security** .  
![update & security](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/update-security-2.jpg)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Windows will then download and install the available patches. It might take some time (up to 30 mins).  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windows-security-update-click-check-for-update.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 To confirm you’ve installed _all_  the system updates, **repeat these steps** until it prompts “You’re up to date” when you click **Check for updates** .

After installing all the updates, restart your PC and check the gameplay.

 If RDR2 still stutters on your latest system, you can try the next fix below.

### Fix 2: Change power plan to Ultimate performance

**Power plan** is a setting that allows you to manage how your system consumes energy. In addition to the existing High performance power plan, Microsoft rolled out a hidden one named**Ultimate performance** a while ago. You can try this plan and see if things work out for you.

1. On your keyboard, press **Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) at the same time. Type or paste **powercfg.cpl**  and press **Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/cmd-run-power-option.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
2. Select **Ultimate Performance** . (If you don’t see this power plan, simply continue to the next step to unhide it.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/change-power-plan-ultimate-performance.jpg)
3. On your keyboard, press Win (the Windows logo key) and type **cmd** . Select **Run as Administrator** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
4. In the command prompt, type or paste the following command and press **Enter** .  
powercfg -duplicatescheme e9a42b02-d5df-448d-aa00-03f14749eb61  
 If you see a prompt similar to this, **return to step 2** to enable the Ultimate Performance power plan.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Now you can start RDR2 and check if it stutters again.

 If this fix doesn’t give you luck, you can continue to the next one below.

### Fix 3: Update your graphics driver

 Game stuttering can be triggered by**a faulty or outdated graphics driver** . Manufacturers keep updating drivers to enhance in-game performance, especially for popular & award-winning titles like RDR2\. That’s why we always recommend keeping your drivers up to date.

 Rockstar has recently released a[NVIDIA DLSS update](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/red-dead-redemption-2-nvidia-dlss-upgrade-out-now/) for the Red Dead Redemption series, featuring a massive (up to 45%) performance boost.

 You can update the graphics driver manually, by visiting the graphics card manufacturer’s website ([NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ), finding the latest installer for your model and installing step by step. But if you don’t have the time or patience to update drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/last-scan-never.png)
3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the[**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/de-2060-super-update.jpg)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

 Once you’ve updated your graphics driver, restart your computer and test the gameplay in RDR2 again.

 If the latest GPU driver doesn’t do the trick for you, you can move on to the next fix.

### Fix 4: Enable HAGs

 HAGs is short for**hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling** . It’s a feature that comes with a recent Windows update designed to boost in-game FPS. There’re reports showing that HAGs might help with the FPS in RDR2, so you can try it and test the results.

 HAGs requires the **latest 2004 version Windows** , a   **GeForce 10 series or later/Radeon 5600 or 5700 series graphics card** with the **latest driver** .

1. In the empty area of your desktop, right-click and select **Display settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/hags-1.jpg)
2. Under the **Multiple displays** section, click **Graphics settings** .

### Fix 5: Disable all mods

 The Red Dead Redemption series is also famous for the large number of mods. There’s a mod that allows players to turn themselves into animals, and one with which gamers can fly in a hot air balloon. Though fun, it’s worth noting that mods might be the culprit of your FPS issues. So if you’re using any mods in RDR2, turn them off and see how it goes.

### Fix 6: Fine tune in-game settings

 There’re reports showing frame-drops at certain scenes can be fixed by**changing game settings** . So after trying the fixes above to make the most of your hardware, you can also play with the in-game graphics settings to get the most FPS.

1. Launch Red Dead Redemption 2 and go to**SETTINGS > GRAPHICS** .
2. Set**TAA** to**medium** . Turn off**FXAA** and**MSAA** .
