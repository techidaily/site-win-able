### Method 3: Reinstall Steam

 If you have this problem when you try to start Steam, you can reinstall Steam on your computer to try to solve the problem. In this case, Steam will reload a new steamui.dll file on your Windows computer.

 If you have the problem with other programs, then simply reinstall the exact program with the problem occurs.

### Method 4: Copy the steamui.dll file from a friends’s PC

 If unfortunately, all the previous methods fails to help, you can copy the steamui.dll file from a PC that runs the same Windows system as yours.

**Part 1:**   Check your Windows system type and find a computer that runs the same system with yours.

Here’s how you can check Windows type of a computer:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key**   to bring up the Search box.
2. Type **system information**   and then select **System Information**   from the result.

3. You should then see the system type of the computer.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc461cb24500.jpg)

**Part 2:**  Copy the steamui.dll file from the working computer and then paste it to the problem computer.

Here’s how you can find the dll file:

1. On the keyboard of the working computer, press the **Windows logo key**   and **E**   at the same time to bring up the File Explorer.
2. Go to **C:WindowsSystem32** , then type **steamui.dll**  and press **Enter** . If it shows no results, go to **C:WindowsSysWOW64**  instead and search **steamui.dll** again.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bc561b04adb9.jpg)
3. Copy the steamui.dll file if found and paste it into the **same location**   as where you copy the file in your problem computer.

**Note:**   Keep in mid that not every computer with the same system type has the dll file you want to restore, so this method is not always successful either.

### PRO TIP: Update your device drivers

 An old, missing or corrupted driver might not cause this problem to occur, but it’ll cause problems to your video games, especially a wrong video driver. So we highly recommend **keeping your drivers up-to-date for the best gaming experience** .

 You can download the latest video driver from your video card’s manufacturer’s website, like AMD, NVIDIA.

Or
