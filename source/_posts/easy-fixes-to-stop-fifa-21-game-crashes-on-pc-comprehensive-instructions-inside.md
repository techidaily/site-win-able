 After the process completes, you can restart your computer for the changes to take effect. Then, launch FIFA 21 and see if the crashing issue reoccurs. If yes, please continue to the next method.

### Fix 3 – Update your device drivers

 If rolling back the graphics driver doesn’t help, it’s likely that your device drivers are faulty or outdated. To fix the constant FIFA 21 crashes and avoid other potential gaming issues, you should update your device drivers to the latest version.

 You can do this manually by going to the manufacturer’s websites, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

 If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, we recommend using Driver Easy. **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your devices, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

**1)** **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/2020-10-16_17-32-34.jpg)
