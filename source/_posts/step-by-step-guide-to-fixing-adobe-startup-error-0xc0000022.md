## 1\. Run Battle.net as an administrator and in compatibility mode

 When a program fails to launch, it may due to the lack of administrative rights. All you have to do is try to open your Battle.net as an administrator. In addition, running it in compatibility mode is aslo one way to fix common issues. Simply follow the steps below.

1. Right-click on the Battle.net shortcut and select**Properties** .

2. Select the**Compatibility** tab. Check the box next to**Run this program in compatibility mode for:** and**Run this program as an administrator** . Then click**Apply > OK** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. Allow Battle.net through Windows Firewall

 Windows Firewall is an important part of a layered security model that helps protect your computer from malicious attacks by blocking unauthorized network traffic flowing into or out of the local device. However, sometimes it may mistakenly identify your legitimate programs such as Battle.net as security threats and prevent them from launching. To verify if that’s your case, you should perform the steps as follows to manually add Battle.net to your Windows Firewall whitelist.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type**control firewall.cpl** and hit Enter.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/how-to-allow-a-program-through-Windows-Firewall-1.jpg)
3. From the left navigation pane, click**Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/how-to-allow-a-program-through-Windows-Firewall-2.jpg)
4. Scroll down and check if Battle.net is on the list. If it isn’t, proceed to add it to the exception list.
5. Click on the**Change settings** button.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Now open Battle.net. If it isn’t opening, try the next fix below.

## 3\. Close conflicting programs running in the background

 Failure to launch a program may occur when there are software conflicts. In addition, at times, Batte.net may require significant system resources in order to function properly. If there are too many programs running in the background, they can eat up your system resources and thus make your resources insufficient for other programs. Therefore, we suggest you disable them while you’re using Battle.net. Below are the steps you can take to do this.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** to open the Run box.
2. Type**taskmgr** and hit Enter to open the Task Manager.  

![open Task Manager](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/open-task-manager.png)
3. Under the **Processes**  tab, right-click the programs that are most likely to cause interference, such as Razer Synapse and those that are eating up your resources. Then select **End task** .  

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4620778&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/07dd4d5a72f5740ef0f035f201951476/728__90banner.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/end-task.png)

 When you’re done, open the agent and check if your problem has been resolved. If it persists, move on to the next fix.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 4\. Download & install all Windows updates

 Your issue may have something to do with your outdated Windows version. To troubleshoot your issue, you should download and install all Windows updates, which usually bring new features and most importantly, bug fixes. To do this, follow the instructions below.

1. In the search box on the taskbar, type**check for updates** . Then click **Check for updates**  from the list of results.  

![how to download and install Windows updates](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/check-for-updates.png)
2. Click**Check for updates** . Then it will start checking for updates. When updates are available, follow the on-screen instructions to download and install them for your system.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/click-on-the-Check-for-updates-tab.png)

 After you’ve finished the process, restart your PC and try to launch the agent. If it still fails to open properly, try the next fix below.

## 5\. Update your drivers

 Each piece of hardware on your system, be it your video card, sound card or others, has its own specific driver, which ensures that different hardware components can work smoothly on your system. However, these hardware drivers are susceptible to corruption. When that happens, your PC performance would suffer and some programs may fail to work properly as expected. In this situation, you should attempt to update your drivers.

 There are mainly two ways you can update your drivers:[manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and **[automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

### Option 1: Manually update your drivers

You can update your drivers via the Device Manager:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter.  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/how-to-open-the-Device-Manager-Run-Command）.png)
3. Click on the**arrow >** to expand the section. Then right-click on the device that you’re going to update the driver for and select**Update driver** .

## 6\. Repair corrupted system files

 If none of the above methods didn’t give you any luck, it’s time to dig deeper. It’s that you might have corrupted system files that could cause a wide variety of issues, ranging from minor glitches to critical performance issues.

To do this, follow the steps below.

1. In the search box on the taskbar, type**cmd** . Find Command Prompt from the list of results and right-click it. Then select**Run as administrator** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/how-to-open-the-Command-Prompt-as-an-administrator.jpg)
2. Click**Yes** when you receive a prompt.
3. Now copy and paste the following command, and then press**Enter** .  

`DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth`
4. Wait until you see a message saying “The operation completed successfully.”

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/how-to-run-the-system-file-checker.jpg)
5. Now type**sfc /scannow** and press Enter. Then it’ll start scanning the integrity of all protected operating system files and replace incorrect, corrupted, changed, or damaged versions with the correct versions.  

 When you see a message that says “Verification 100% complete”, type**exit** and press Enter.
