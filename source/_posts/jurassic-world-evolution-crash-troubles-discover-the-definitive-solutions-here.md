### Fix 1 – Update your graphics driver

 Graphics card driver is vital to the game performance. So, to prevent Jurassic World Evolution from crashing and avoid other potential issues, you should keep your graphics driver up to date.

There are two ways you can update the graphics driver:

**Manually** – You can download the most recent correct graphics driver from the manufacturer’s website, such as[**AMD**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ,[**NVIDIA**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) or[**Intel**](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/) . Be sure to choose only drivers that are compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatically** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 3 – Remove conflicting applications
