**7)** Restart your game to test your issue.

If AoE still won’t launch, move on and try the fix below.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 Often times when a game fails, the main culprit behind this is your graphics card driver. You may be using a faulty graphics driver or it’s outdated, which causes the game to crash.

 So, when something goes wrong with Age of Empires 2, updating your graphics driver should always be your go-to option. There are two ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your drivers manually by going to your hardware manufacturer’s website, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your hardware, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support and a 30-day money back guarantee** . You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

 Or click the **Update button** next to the graphics driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).
