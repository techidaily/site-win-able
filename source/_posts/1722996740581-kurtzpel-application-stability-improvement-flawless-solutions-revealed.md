### Fix 2: Unblock program in your antivirus software

 One common cause for the crashing issue is your antivirus software block some features of the game and cause crashes. So go to your antivirus software and unblock the game program to fix the crash.

### Fix 3: Run as administrator

 The privilege issue might be the reason for this problem. With high integrity access, KurtzPel can make full use of its features, so run the game as an administrator to see if this fixes your issue.

 If you know how to open the game directly from the folder in your PC files, you can jump to step 6.

1. Exit KurtzPel.
2. Run Steam.
3. In the**LIBRARY** , right-click on**KurtzPel** .
4. Click**Properties** .

5. Go to the**LOCAL FILES** tab and click BROWSE LOCAL FILES.

### Fix 4: Verify game files

 Verify integrity of game files is a simple but useful fix for Steam games. Broken and missing files could be the culprit of the crashing issue. This fix can redownload files to fix it.

1. Run Steam.
2. In the**LIBRARY** , find the**KurtzPel** and right-click on it, click **Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-01-14_15-38-52.jpg)

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2020-01-14_17-22-08.jpg)
4. Close Steam and relaunch KurtzPel. You should be good to go.

### Fix 5: Update game patches

 Game developers will keep releasing new patches to improve the game performance and fix issues, so it would be a good idea to update your game to the latest version. Update the game to the latest version may help you fix the crashing issue.

 If you have problems during updating or installing the game, you can read this[Steam Support](https://support.steampowered.com/kb%5Farticle.php?ref=2274-IFLV-5334) for more information.

## Update your drivers

 Updating your drivers regularly can help your computer prevent many potential problems and also improve your gaming experience. Windows 10 doesnâ€™t always give you the latest version, but with outdated or wrong drivers, your devices may not work in full functions and even cause trouble.

 There are two ways you can update your driver: manually and automatically.

**[Option 1 â€“ Manually](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ Youâ€™ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 â€“ Automatically (Recommended)](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/how-to-fix-kurtzpel-crashing-issue-solved/#op2)**  â€“ This is the quickest and easiest option. Itâ€™s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks â€“ easy even if youâ€™re a computer newbie.

#### **Option 1 â€“** **Download and install the driver manually**

 You can download graphics drivers from the manufacturer official website. Search for the model you have and find the correct driver that suits your specific operating system. Then download the driver manually.

#### **Option 2 â€“ Automatically update drivers**

 If you donâ€™t have time or patience to manually update your graphics drivers, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE** or the **Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back guarantee** ):

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/NVIDIA-18.jpg)
3. Click the **Update**  button next to the flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  
 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. Youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
