### Fix1: Update your graphics driver

 The_Paladins_ crashing issue is most likely to occur if you’re using the wrong graphics driver or it’s out of date. So, updating your graphics driver should always be your go-to option when something goes wrong with your game. There are two ways you can do this:

* [**Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
* [**Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 The manufacturer of your graphics card keeps updating the driver. To get the latest correct driver, you need to go to the manufacturer website, find the driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update your graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)**  Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now**  button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

**3)** Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_  the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/显卡更新图片-1.png)

 You can do it for free if you like, but it’s partly manual.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .**

**4)** Restart your PC and the game.

 If this didn’t resolve the issue, then move on and try the next fix.

### Fix 2: End unnecessary background programs

 Some programs running on the background may conflict with Steam or_Paladins_ , causing the crashing issue to occur. So, you should close unnecessary programs during gameplay. Here is how to do it:

* **[If you’re on Windows 7…](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
* **[If you’re on Windows 8 or 10…](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

#### If you’re on Windows 7…

**1)**  Right-click your taskbar and select **Start Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-763-1.png)

**2)** Click the **Processes** tab. Then, check your current **CPU and memory usage** to see what processes are consuming your resources most.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-794-1.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**3)** Right-click the process you want to end and select **End Process Tree** .

 Don’t close any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-809-1.png)

 Try launching _Paladins_ again to see if this has resolved your issue. If not, try **[fix 3](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , below.

#### If you’re on Windows 8 or 10…

**1)**  Right-click your taskbar and select **Task Manager** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-762-1.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**2)** Check your current **CPU and memory usage** to see what processes are consuming your resources most.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-805-1.png)

**3)**  Right-click the process you want to end and select **End task** .

 Don’t close any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-810-1.png)

 Try launching_Paladins_ to see if it works properly now. If your issue persists, check the next fix.

### Fix 3: Run_Paladins_ as an administrator

 Windows runs programs in user mode by default. Under this mode,_Paladins_ may not be able to access certain game files. To see if that’s the cause of the_Paladins_ crashing, try running your game as an administrator to give it high integrity access. Follow the instructions below:

**1)**  If you’re running Steam now, right-click the **Steam icon** on the taskbar and select **Exit** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-342-1.png)

**2)**  Right-click the **Steam icon**  and select **Run as administrator** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-352-1.png)

**3)** Click **Yes** .

**4)** Launch_Paladins_ from Steam.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-353-1.png)

 Hope this worked for you. If your game crashes again, then go ahead with the next fix.

### Fix 4: Verify the integrity of your game files

 You’re likely to run into the crashing issue on_Paladins_ when a certain game file is damaged or missing. To fix it, try verifying the integrity of your game files on Steam. Here is how to do it:

**1)** Run Steam.

**2)** Click**LIBRARY** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-355-604x79-1-1.png)

**3)** Right-click**Paladins** and select**Properties** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1021.png)

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2144308/7443" target="_top" id="2144308">

<img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2144308/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**4)** Click the**LOCAL FILES** tab, then click**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/image-1022.png)

**5)** This could take several minutes. Wait for the process to be complete. (Steam will fix corrupted files if it detects any.) Then, relaunch your game to test your issue.

 If_Paladins_ crashes again, then try the next fix.

### Fix 5: Set your PC power plan to High-Performance

 The power plan on all computers is set to Balanced by default. So, your computer sometimes might slow down automatically to save energy and cause_Paladins_ to crash.

 If that’s the problem for you, you’ll need to change your power plan to High Performance. Follow the instructions below:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **control** . Then, click **Control panel** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-737-1.png)

**2)** Under **View by,** click **Large icons** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-720-1.png)

**3)** Select **Power Options.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-721-1-1.png)

**4)** Select **High Performance** .

**What’re the differences?**
**Balanced:**  Balanced automatically adjust your CPU’s speed according to your computer’s need.  
**High Performance:** High Performance mode keeps your PC running at high speeds most of the time. Note that your computer will generate more heat under the High Performance mode.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-738-1.png)

**5)** Restart your computer and your game.

 This should fix the_Paladins_ crashing. If it didn’t, move on to the fix below.

### Fix 6: Adjust your virtual memory

 Virtual memory is basically an extension of your computer’s physical memory. It is a combination of RAM and a portion of your hard drive. If your computer runs out of RAM when performing an intensive task, Windows will dip into virtual memory for temporary file storage. If the size of your virtual memory is not big enough to save temporary files, your programs such as_Paladins_ are likely to crash.

 Follow the instructions below to adjust the size of your virtual memory and see if this is causing your problem:

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-884-1.png)

**2)** Click **View advanced system settings.**

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-882-1.png)

**3)** Click **Settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-881.png)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**4)**  Click the **Advanced**  tab, and then click **Change** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-880-2.png)

**5)** Uncheck the box next to **Automatically manage paging file size for all drives** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/pasted-image-0-3-1.png)

**6)** Click your **C drive** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-879-1.png)

**7)** Click the option button next to **Custom size** , and then type **4096** in the text box next to **Initial size (MB)**  and **Maximum size (MB)** .

 Microsoft recommends that you set your virtual memory three times the size of your physical memory (RAM) or 4 GB (4096M), whichever is larger.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-909-1.png)

**8)** Click **Set** , and then click **OK** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-877-1.png)

**9)** Restart your computer and your game.

 If_Paladins_ is still unplayable, read on and check the fix below.

### Fix 7: Check for Windows updates

 Windows updates can address bugs related to both hardware and software. So make sure you’ve installed all the new Windows updates to keep_Paladins_ running smoothly. Here is how to do it:

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key. Then, type **windows update** and select **Windows Update settings** .

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/image-575-1.png)
