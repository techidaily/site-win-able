### 3\. Update your graphics driver

 When your game keeps crashing, you would need to consider whether it’s caused by an outdated or misconfigured graphics driver. If you can’t remember when was the last time you updated your drivers, definitely do it right now. This is probably the best shot you have got without doing a lot of troubleshooting. Additionally, graphics card manufacturers usually release game ready drivers to guarantee that you can get the most out of your graphics card.

 To update your graphics driver, you can either do it manually via the Device Manager or head to the manufacturer’s driver download page to download and install the exact driver for your system. This requires a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an**automatic driver updater** such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as it will take care of the busy work for you.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any devices with missing or outdated drivers.

## If your game still crashes

Here’s how you can run a scan of your PC with Reimage:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Fortect.
2. Start Fortect and it will run a FREE scan of your PC. Once the scan is finished, you’ll see a complete overview of your system and issues.
3. Click**Start Repair** to start the repair process and wait for Fortect to fix the problem.

## How to fix the stuttering issue

 Nothing all methods are necessary; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

1. **[Disable V-Sync](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Disable Steam overlay](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Enable game mode](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Enable hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Delete temp files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

## 1\. Disable V-Sync

 Short for vertical sync, V-Sync is a graphics technology that synchronizes the frame rate of your game to the refresh rate of your monitor. Unfortunately, sometimes V-Sync reduces the input responsiveness of your system while gaming, which can cause your computer to crash. And performance issues would arise.

 To see if this is what’s causing your Bloodhunt to stutter a lot, you should disable V-Sync by following the instructions below.

1. Launch your game. Then press Esc on your keyboard.
2. Select**SETTINGS** .

 If disabling V-Sync doesn’t give you any luck, try the next fix below.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## 2\. Disable Steam overlay

 Commonly used in various programs, overlay technology allows you to surf the web and enjoy other features, but can also cause performance issues with some games. Therefore, you may need to disable the Steam overlay and check if it can reduce Bloodhunt in-game stutters. Here’s how you can do this:

1. Open your Steam client. Under LIBRARY, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/properties.png)
2. In the GENERAL tab, uncheck the box**Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** .  

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/disable-overlay.png)

 If the above doesn’t solve your issue, make sure you’re not running the Rivatuner overlay. Players who are running it are more likely to notice in-game stutters.

### 3\. Enable game mode

 After the new release of Windows updates, the game mode feature helps users increase gaming performance by deactivating background activities like app notifications. So you can actually enable this feature to benefit from it. To do this, follow the steps below.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + I keys** simultaneously to open Settings.
2. Click **Gaming** .

 After applying the changes, test your gameplay. If you still notice severe in-game stutters, try the next fix below.

### 4\. Enable hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling

 Hardware-accelerated GPU scheduling is a feature that comes with a recent Windows update designed to provide users with a performance boost. If you have the latest Windows version, a Geforce 10 series or later/ Radeon 5600 or 5700 series graphics card with the latest driver, you can enable this feature and see if it smooths your gameplay. Follow the instructions to do this.

1. Right-click on the empty space from your desktop and select **Display settings** .  

![enable hardware-acceleration GPU scheduling](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/display-settings-1.png)
