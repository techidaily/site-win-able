### Fix 2: Adjust your graphics settings

 Scavenger has a myriad of graphics setting options at your disposal. Ideally, having “ultra” or “high” settings allows you to max out the performance of the game, but it could lead to crashing. If you have these strenuous settings, you should dial them down a bit to see if it helps with the situation.

 Here I have listed the recommended settings for playing Scavenger, which you can start with and then test on your own until you find that right spot of balance.

| **OptionAnti-Aliasing:Option** | **Recommended Setting** |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Game Mode                      | Windowed mode           |
| Resolution                     | Native                  |
| Resolution scaling             | Disabled                |
| VSync                          | Disabled                |
| DLSS                           | Off                     |
| Anti-Aliasing                  | Low                     |

### Fix 3: Update Unreal Engine 4 (if you’re on Epic Games Launcher)

 If Scavengers crashes while you’re on Unreal Engine, it is possible that the current version of Unreal Engine on your launcher is faulty or corrupt, causing Scavenger to crash. In this case, you can check for a newer Unreal Engine, install it to see if it solves your woe.

Here is how to do it:

1. Open**Epic Games** **Launcher** , click **Unreal Engine** \> **Library** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ue.png)
2. From there, you will see your current version of Unreal Engine. Click the**down arrow** to see if you have the latest one installed.
3. If there’s a more up-to-date version, select the latest version and click**Install** .
4. Fire up Scavenger and see if you can play properly. If it still doesn’t give you luck, please head on to**Fix 4** , below.

### Fix 4: Update DirectX

 Your game of Scavengers may crash if you don’t have the latest version of DirectX. So you should check on your PC whether you have the latest version; if you don’t, you should update it.

 To check your DirectX version:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo ke** y, then copy & paste **dxdiag** into the box and click **dxdiag** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dxdiag.jpg)
2. Check out your **DirectX version** in the first page of the report.

 Currently, the most up-to-date version for DirectX is DirectX12\. If you’re presented with a lower version, follow the steps below to update it.

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** and type **check for updates** , then click on **Check for updates** as it pops up as a matching result.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/12-1-1.png)
2. Click **Check for updates** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

With the latest DirectX, check to see if Scavengers still crashes.

### Fix 5: Close background apps

 Having too many apps running in the background at the same time may also cause your game to crash. These apps compete for CPU, memory and network bandwidth and even induce instability issues.

 To make sure you close all these bandwidth-hogging programs, you can disable all startup items and launch only Scavengers on your computer.

Here’s how to close background apps:

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** **key** , then press **Ctrl** , **Shift**  and **Esc**  keys at the same time to bring up Task Manager.
2. Select the **Startup**  tab, then right-click on each item and click **Disable** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/123-1.png)
3. Restart your computer.

4. Run Scavengers on your PC to see if the issue is solved. If it still persists, please try**Fix 6** , below.

### Fix 6: Stop overclocking

 Many players have overlocked their CPU or GPU to squeeze extra performance out of the existing components. The downside is that, high clock speed may induce stability issues and even crashes to your system.

 If your game starts to crash after you overclock your CPU or GPU, try reverting it to the default setting. After that, fire up Scavenger to see if the crashing issues have ceased.
