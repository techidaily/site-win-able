## 1\. Make sure your PC is capable

 Before trying anything advanced, you need to make sure that your computer meets the requirements listed on the game’s minimum system requirements.

| **OS**        | Windows 7 64-bit, Windows 8.1 64-bit or Windows 10 64-bit         |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Processor** | Intel® Core™ i3-530 @ 2.93 GHz / AMD FX 4100 @ 3.60 GHz or better |
| **Memory**    | 4 GB RAM                                                          |
| **Graphics**  | NVIDIA® GeForce® GT 450 1GB / ATI® Radeon™ HD 7770 1GB or better  |
| **DirectX**   | Version 11                                                        |
| **Storage**   | 80 GB available space                                             |

 If you’ve confirmed that your PC can handle the game, then you would need to tweak some settings and take the troubleshooting steps below.

## 2\. Verify integrity of game files

 Performance issues can occur due to missing or corrupted game files. To check if that’s what caused the black screen issue, you can attempt to verify the game files:

1. Open your Steam client. Under the LIBRARY tab, right-click your game title and select**Properties** .

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075471/7443" target="_top" id="2075471"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075471" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075471/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

2. In the Properties window, select the**LOCAL FILES** tab and click**VERIFY INTEGRITY OF GAME FILES…** . Then wait for the process to complete.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/nba-2k21-verify-gamefiles-02.jpg)  
 Then you can launch NBA 2K21\. If verifying game files integrity doesn’t give you any luck, proceed to the next fix.

## 3\. Update your graphics driver

 Your graphics driver is an essential piece of software that lets your system communicate with the graphics card. If it is outdated, it would cause noticeable performance problems. Therefore, when your NBA 2K21 is stuck on the black loading screen, you should make sure your graphics card is up-to-date. Driver updates include the latest patches for security flaws, fix problems, and sometimes even provide you with completely new features, all for free.

 To update your graphics driver, you can either do it manually via the Device Manager or head to the manufacturer’s driver download page ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) / [AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) ) to download and install the exact driver for your system. This requires a certain level of computer knowledge and can be a headache if you aren’t tech-savvy. Therefore, we would like to recommend you use an automatic driver updater such as **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . With Driver Easy, you don’t need to waste your time hunting for driver updates as it will take care of the busy work for you.

## 4\. Disable Steam overlay

 The in-game overlay feature allows you to access certain features while playing games. But it is also known to have a negative effect on performance. To alleviate your problem, you’re supposed to disable overlays on Steam:

1. Open your Steam client.
2. Click **Steam** from the sidebar and select **Settings** .  
![disable Steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-Steam-overlay-1.jpg)
3. Click **In-Game** . Uncheck the box **Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game** . Then click **OK**  to save the changes.  
![disable Steam overlay](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/disable-Steam-overlay-2.jpg)  
 After saving the changes, launch your game and you should be able to go into the main screen. However, if none of the fixes listed above work for you, you may need to consider reinstalling your game.
