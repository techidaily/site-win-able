1. Right-click the Windows taskbar and select **Task Manager** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/image-48.png)
2. Select each**Paradox Launcher** related program you see here and click**End Task** to close them one by one.

## 3\. Make sure your Windows is updated

Luckily, most of these required files can be downloaded and installed via Windows Update. So you should make sure that you have the latest available updates installed:

1. On your keyboard, hit the**Windows** key, then type**check for update** s, then click C**heck for updates** .

## 4\. Modify your antivirus program settings

 Windows Defender, or a third-party antivirus program, could mistake your Paradox Launcher as a threat, as it usually consumes a lot of memory and CPU usage when a game is running. To make sure that your antivirus program is not the culprit to the Paradox Launcher not working problem, here are two things that you can do:

### 4.1 Add Steam and the game to the antivirus exception list

 Third-party antivirus applications hook very deep into your system, so it may interfere with Steam and Paradox Launcher. To avoid this problem, you can try   **adding both Steam and Paradox Launcher as exceptions to your third-party antivirus application** .

 If you’re not sure how to do it, please consult your antivirus documentation for further instructions.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 4.2 Make sure bootstrapper-v2.exe is not flagged as a virus

 It was reported by some users that their antivirus program accidentally flagged**bootstrapper-v2.exe** as a virus or PUA (potentially unwanted application), and thus with the Paradox Launcher not working problem.

 In this case, the fix is rather straightforward, just restore bootstrapper-v2.exe from the quarantine section in your anvirus program.

 If Windows Defender is marking this file as a potential threat, you can do the following to restore the file:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and type**windows security** . Then select**Windows Security** from the list.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-7.png)
2. Select**Virus & Threat protection** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-9.png)
3. Under**Current threats** , select**Protection history** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-10.png)
4. If you can see**bootstrapper-v2.exe** or other Paradox Launcher-related services and programs here, click the**Actions** button and select**Restore** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/image-11.png)

 When you finish the above settings, but your Paradox Launcher still doesn’t work, please move on to the other fixes.

## 5\. Repair damaged system files
