## No Charge Fixes for Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War - Beating the Chilling Glitch

Itâ€™s very frustrating when Call of Duty Black Ops Cold War keeps freezing on your PC. While itâ€™s sometimes hard to identify the exact cause, there are simple tricks you can try to fix this issue. Check them out now!

## Try these fixes

 Here are 5 fixes that helped other players with Cold War freezing. You may not try them all; simply work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Avoid PC overheating](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
2. **[Update your graphics card driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
3. **[Disable fullscreen optimizations](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
4. **[Scan and repair corrupted game files](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**
5. **[Lower the in-game graphics settings](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**

### Fix 1 â€“ Avoid PC overheating

 Black Ops Cold War is a graphic-intensive application that will put load on your CPU and GPU. When these component overheats, the computer will stop functioning to protect the hardware from physical damage, and thus your game freezes.

 To avoid this problem, you can**clean the dust regularly** and**check the cooling system** to ensure your PC is in a cool, well-ventilated condition. Also,**stop overclocking your processor** as this will increase the chance of overheating.

 If Call of Duty Cold War just freezes without any overheating symptoms, take a look at other workable fixes.

### Fix 2 â€“ Update your graphics card driver

 If youâ€™re using a faulty graphics driver or itâ€™s out-of-date, you may encounter various issues when playing Black Ops Cold War such as freezing, crashing or low FPS. GPU manufacturers have released new drivers optimized for this game, so you can update the graphics card driver to see if that fixes your issue.

There are two ways for you to do this:

**Option 1 â€“ Manually** â€“ You can get the latest graphics driver from the manufacturerâ€™s website such as **[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  or **[NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx)**  . Then, choose the correct driver that is compatible with your Windows version and install it manually.

**Option 2 â€“ Automatically (recommended)** â€“ If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your video and monitor drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your exact GPU, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/de-1-9.jpg)
3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  â€“ youâ€™ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ). Or you can click**Update** to do it for free, but itâ€™s partly manual.

 Does the driver update mitigate the freezes and boost your gameâ€™s performance? If the problem reoccurs, please continue to the next fix.

### Fix 3 â€“ Disable fullscreen optimizations

 Fullscreen Optimizations is expected to improve gamesâ€™ performance when they run in fullscreen mode, but thatâ€™s not always the case. If you keep running into Cold War freezing, you should disable this option.

1. Right-click the**CoD Black Ops Cold War icon** on your desktop and click**Properties** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/1-1-13.jpg)

 After the process completes, relaunch the game to test the issue. If this fix doesnâ€™t help, check out the last one.

### Fix 5 â€“ Lower the in-game graphics settings

1. While in game, press**F3** on your keyboard to open the Settings menu.
2. Select the**Graphics** tab.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/0-8.jpg)
3. Lower the parameters under each section according to your needs.
