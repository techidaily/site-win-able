Itâ€™s annoying that the game doesnâ€™t start up with sound, or canâ€™t get any sound. If you have the same issue, this post may help.

## Try these fixes

 You donâ€™t have to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works for you.

2. [Update audio driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Install Windows updates](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Fix 1: Use wire headsets

Hope it works for you, if not, try updating your audio driver.

### Fix 2: Update the audio driver

 Update your audio driver might fix. Driver is closely related to the audio issue, an outdated or corrupted audio driver would cause sound issue.
