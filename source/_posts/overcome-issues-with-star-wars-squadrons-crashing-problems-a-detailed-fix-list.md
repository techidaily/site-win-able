### 2\. Use a VPN

 If it’s not a server problem, a VPN may help you fix the issue. Using a VPN would change the server you linked and make a difference. A paid VPN provides you a safe and better internet performance.

[**Express VPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and[**NordVPN**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) are big brands with good reputations.

 Here we take **[NordVPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  as an example:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  NordVPN on your device.
2. Run NordVPN and open it.
3. Connect to a server in a chosen location.

 By the way, you can temporarily disable your firewalls, antivirus software to make sure it’s not your firewall blocking part of the game and cause the problem. Make sure that “EA.exe” is unblocked.

 Please be aware of any suspicious links or websites when you disabled your firewalls and antivirus software.

### 3\. Update your driver

 The error code is related to the network connectivity which network driver involves. If you have an outdated network adapter driver, you may encounter various network issues such as disconnect from an online game. This may not the fix for a specific problem, but it’s no harm to upgrade your driver to make your PC work efficiently.

 You can manually update your driver by going to the manufacturer’s official website or do it automatically with[**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** [](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy, then click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

1. Press the**Windows logo key** +**R** to open the Run box.
2. Type**cmd** and press the**Ctrl + Shift + Enter** key to run as administrator.
3. Type`**ipconfig /release**` and press**Enter** .
4. Type`**ipconfig /flushdns**` and press**Enter** to flush the DNS cache.
5. Type`**ipconfig /renew**` and press**Enter** to renew the IP configuration for the active adapters.
6. Close the Command Prompt and reboot the game to check.
