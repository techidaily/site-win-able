 It's easy to [sort data in Excel](https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/free-audio-treasures-to-amplify-youtube-in-2024/) alphabetically or numerically. But maybe you want to sort based on color, formatting, or a list like months of the year. We'll show you different ways to sort data in Excel.

 You can use the quick sort for those basic options or create a custom sort that gives you more flexibility. Whatever your data, be it text or numbers, take a look at these various ways you can sort it.

##  A to Z Sorting

 If you want to sort by text in alphabetical order or numbers like currency or decimals in numerical order, you can do this in Excel in just a few clicks.

Related: [How to Sort Values in Microsoft Excel](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/steps-to-resolve-iphone-image-failure-in-windows-os/) 

 Select the data you want to sort and open the Sort tool one of these ways:

* On the Home tab, select "Sort & Filter" in the Editing section of the ribbon. At the top of the pop-up box, choose "Sort A to Z" or "Sort Z to A."
* On the Data tab, select "A - Z" or "Z - A" in the Sort section of the ribbon.

![Sort options on the Data tab](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/DataSortAZ-ExcelWaysSortData.png) 

 Your data is then sorted in the order you picked, either alphabetically from A to Z or the reverse. This option also [sorts numbers](https://win11-tips.techidaily.com/steps-to-resolve-iphone-image-failure-in-windows-os/) the same way, from lowest to highest or the opposite.

![Sorted data from Z to A](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/SortedZtoA-ExcelWaysSortData.png) 

 You can also use the A to Z sorting when you create a custom sort which we'll describe next.

##  Row Sorting

 For more advanced options in Excel like sorting by row instead of column, you can create a custom sort.

 Select your data, go to the Data tab, and click "Sort" in the Sort & Filter section of the ribbon. Then, click "Options" at the top of the Sort box.

##  Color Sorting

 Also using the custom sort option in Excel, you can [sort by color](https://some-skills.techidaily.com/in-2024-unlocking-potential-with-efficient-audio-submission/). This allows you to sort your data by the cell or font color. Select your data and then "Sort" on the Data tab to open the Sort box.

 One convenient sorting option many don't realize exists in Excel is list sorting. For instance, you may want to sort by day of the week or month of the year. Select your data and then "Sort" on the Data tab to open the Sort box.

 Choose the following in the drop-down boxes:

* **Sort by**: Pick the column or row containing the list items.
* **Sort on**: Pick "Cell Values."
* **Order**: Pick "Custom List." Then choose an existing list in the Custom Lists section and click "OK."

##  New List Sorting

 Another way to sort using a list is with a new custom list. This is convenient if you haven't had time to [create the custom list](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/maximizing-fps-essential-tricks-for-optimizing-fallout-76-performance/) in Excel yet, because you can make it with the sort tool. Select your data and then "Sort" on the Data tab to open the Sort box.

Related: [How to Create a Custom List in Microsoft Excel](https://win-blog.techidaily.com/maximizing-fps-essential-tricks-for-optimizing-fallout-76-performance/) 

 Choose the following in the drop-down boxes:

* **Order**: Pick "Custom List." Select "New List," click "Add," and then enter each list item in the List Entries box. Be sure to enter them in the order you want them. Click "OK" when you finish.

![Create a new list and entries box](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/CreateList-ExcelWaysSortData.png)

##  Multi-Level Sorting

 If you'd like to sort by more than one column or row in Excel, you can add another level when you create a [custom sort](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-gopro-versus-polaroid-editing-faces-vs-cameras-that-shoot-them/). For example, you might sort alphabetically by name first and color second. And, you can add levels to any of the above sorting methods if you like.

Related: [How to Use the Microsoft Excel SORT Function](https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/2024-approved-gopro-versus-polaroid-editing-faces-vs-cameras-that-shoot-them/) 

 In the Sort box, set up your first sort option with the drop-down boxes. Then, choose "Add Level" and set up the secondary sort you want to use.

![Add Level button in the Sort box](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/AddLevel-ExcelWaysSortData.png) 

 Keep in mind that, Excel sorts your data based on this list of levels from top to bottom. So if needed, you can rearrange them. Select a level and then use the arrow buttons to move that level up or down.

![Multiple sort levels and arrows to rearrange them](https://static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/MoveLevel-ExcelWaysSortData.png) 

 When you finish, click "OK" to apply the sort for your multiple levels.
