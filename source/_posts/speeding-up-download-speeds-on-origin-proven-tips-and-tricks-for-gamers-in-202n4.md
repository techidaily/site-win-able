 With so many devices connected to your network, Origin download can be quite slow. So if possible, disconnect them while downloading.

## If your problem persists

 If nothing else helped, give VPNs a try. By connecting to a different server, you’re able to avoid bandwidth throttling. But be advised: lots of problems may arise if you use a free VPN. To secure your network, we suggest you use a paid VPN.

Below is the VPN we would like to recommend:

* **[Nord VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  (30-day money-back guarantee)
* **[Surfshark](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fr.brandreward.com%2F%3Fkey%3D3882aba4cadd4473e0195097fdf20855%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fsurfshark.com%252Fvpn-free-trial%26id%3Ddrivereasy-en-122442)**  (7-day free trial)
* **[CyberGhost](https://r.brandreward.com/?key=3882aba4cadd4473e0195097fdf20855&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cyberghostvpn.com%2Fen%5FUS%2Fvpn-free-trial&id=drivereasy-en-122442)**  (free trial available)
