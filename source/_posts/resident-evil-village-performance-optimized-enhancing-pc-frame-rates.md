## Path of Exile Performance Boost: Bid Farewell to Frustrating Game Lag

You may run into the_Path of Exile (PoE)_ freezing issue for several reasons, such as incompatible hardware, faulty drivers, corrupt game files, software conflicts, low RAM, etc.

 The information here is a general guide that has proved useful to many players in fixing this issue. You may not have to try them all, just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick for you.

### Fix 1: End unnecessary programs

 The game freezing issue commonly occurs when you’re running multiple applications simultaneously on your PC. It’s probable that your computer doesn’t have enough power or memory to support all of the programs you’re opening. So, you should end unnecessary programs while gaming.

Follow the instructions below:

**1)**  Right-click your taskbar and select **Task Manager** .

**2)** Check your current **CPU and memory usage** to see what processes are consuming your resources most.

**3)**  Right-click the resource-consuming process and select **End task** .

 Don’t end any program that you’re not familiar with. It may be critical for the functioning of your computer.

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019-11-01_10-58-35.jpg)

 Relaunch your game to see if it runs properly now. If the issue continues to occur, read on and try the next fix.

### Fix 2: Update your graphics driver

 The _PoE_ freezing issue may occur if you are using the wrong graphics driver or it’s out of date. So you should update your graphics driver to see if it fixes your problem. There are two ways you can do this:

**Manual driver update** – You can update your graphics driver manually by going to the manufacturer’s website for your graphics product, and searching for the most recent correct driver. Be sure to choose only driver that is compatible with your Windows version.

**Automatic driver update** – If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update your graphics driver manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct driver for your graphics product, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

 **1)[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

**2)** Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

### Fix 4: Verify the integrity of your game files

### Fix 5: Increase virtual memory

**1)** On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo** key and type **advanced system settings.** Then, click **View advanced system settings.**

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 Restart your computer and your game. If your issue still exists, try the fix, below.

### Fix 7: Reinstall Steam

**1)**  On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo**  key and type **control** . Then, click **Control Panel** .

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Fix 8: Clean the interior of your PC

 Your computer is prone to overheating if it’s clogged with dust. The dust can cause ventilation problems, trapping heat and preventing your PC from cooling itself properly. As a result, your game might not be able to run smoothly.

 So you should clean your computer’s case to prevent dust build-up. (If you aren’t comfortable opening your computer case, you may want to hire a technician to do it for you.)

 After cleaning up your PC case, carefully remove the RAM module from the slot and look for corrosion. If everything is fine, reinstall the module and make sure that it’s seated securely in the socket.

Relaunch the game to see if this helped.

 Hopefully, you’re able to play the game now! Feel free to leave a comment below if you have any questions or suggestions.
