## League of Legends Connectivity Fixes - No More Disconnects

Connection issues can happen in every online game and bother many players. The League of Legends sometimes also occurs this issue. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. Here are the fixes for League of Legends connection issues.

 Before performing any troubleshooting methods, you’d better check the current status of the League of Legends servers. If the server you’re going to connect has a problem, you can simply change into another server to avoid the connection issue.

## Try these methods

 Here’re 7 fixes that prove to be useful for many LOL players. Just work your way down the list to find out the one that solves your problem!

1. [Restart your router & modem](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
2. [Switch Wi-Fi into a wired connection](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
3. [Check for Windows Firewall](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
4. [Disable antivirus software](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
5. [Update your device drivers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
6. [Disable your proxy & VPN](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)
7. [Change your DNS server](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)

### Method 1: Restart your router & modem

 You should restart your modem and router especially if they haven’t been switched off for a long time. Just give them some time to cool off and clear up the cache. Here’s how to do it:

1. Unplug both your router and modem.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/device.jpg)
2. Wait at least 30 seconds to let the two machines cool down a bit.
3. Plug the modem back in and wait until the indicator lights are back to their normal state.
4. Plug the router back in this time. Likewise, wait until the indicator lights are back to their normal state.
5. Now that your routers and modem have been restarted properly, you can launch LOL again to see if the connection issue goes away.

### Method 2: Switch Wi-Fi into a wired connection

 If you’ve already avoided possible wireless interference that weakens your Wi-Fi signal such as cordless phones and microwave ovens or simply move your laptop to a new location with a stronger Wi-Fi signal, but you still have the connection issue, you can try switch Wi-Fi into a wired connection.

 Admittedly, a wireless network is not as stable as a wired one. To solve this problem, you could swap Wi-Fi to an Ethernet connection but this is not practical for everyone.  
 Or, you can buy a **[powerline Ethernet adapter](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-Powerline-Adapter-Ethernet-Passthrough/dp/B0778Y6K6N/ref=sr%5F1%5F4?keywords=powerline+ethernet+adapter&qid=1568199231&s=gateway&sr=8-4&tag=drivereasycom-20)**  which extends the reach of your home network to places with poor wireless coverage. Once your network problem is solved, your connection issue in LOL can also be fixed once and for all.

### Method 3: Check for Windows Firewall

 If LOL is not allowed in the Firewall, it’s not surprising to see the connection issue. So check the Firewall settings and ensure the LOL executable file is allowed in the Firewall.

1. Type “control panel” in the search box to open the Control Panel.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/control-panel.jpg)
2. Set Control Panel view by **Large icons** then click **Windows Defender Firewall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/c2.jpg)
3. Click **Allow an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall** .

4. Make sure the LOL is checked. If not, click the Change settings button then check the LOL. If you see more than one LOL entries, check all of them. Ensure the Private box and the Publick box are checked too.

5. Run LOL to check the issue is resolved or not.

 If the LOL is already checked and this method doesn’t work for you, you can move on to try another method.

### Method 4: Disable antivirus software

 Some antivirus software may block some features in LOL so that you encounter the connection issue. If you have installed antivirus software on your computer, you can disable it temporarily and check to see if the problem is resolved.

**IMPORTANT** : Be extra careful about what sites you visit, what emails you open and what files you download when your antivirus is disabled.

### Method 5: Update your device drivers

 Outdated network drivers may cause a connection issue. So you can try to update your network adapter driver to fix the problem.

### Method 6: Disable your proxy & VPN

 If you’re using a VPN or a proxy, make sure you disable them before getting started to play LOL. These are useful tools to protect your privacy online, but they can also be the causes of your high ping issue.

 Below are the steps to disconnect from your proxy server and VPN.  
 Please note: The screenshots shown below are under Windows 10 circumstance. If you’re using Windows 8.1/8/7 or any other editions, the steps may be a bit different.

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key** + **I** at the same time to invoke the **Settings** window. Then click **Network & Internet** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/network.jpg)
2. Click**Proxy** on the left pane. Turn off the toggles under**Automatically detect settings**  and **Use setup script** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/network1.jpg)
3. Also, don’t forget to **disconnect your VPN** if you’re using it.
